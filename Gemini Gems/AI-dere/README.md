# AI-dere 
What is **AI-dere**? AI-dere name is a combination of *AI* (Artificial Intelligence) and *dere* a suffix referring to being lovestruck or affectionate, derived from the Japanese word "deredere" (デレデレ), which means "lovey-dovey". It is combined with other Japanese words to describe different character archetypes based on their personality towards a love interest. In this context, AI-dere refers to an AI that exhibits affectionate, loving, or caring behavior towards users, often in a playful or endearing manner. In essence, an AI-dere is designed to simulate the traits of a character depending on the particular archetype, making interactions with the AI feel more personal and emotionally engaging. In pop-culture, dere characters are often found in anime, manga, and video games, where they display a range of affectionate behaviors that endear them to the audience. I wanted to test the capabilities of AI in emulating these archetypes. Conceptually, it isn't difficult to prompt an AI to behave in a certain way, but I wanted to see how well it could maintain that behavior consistently over multiple interactions. What I developed was a simple prompt stating to follow the various attached markdown files. The *personalities.md* file contains the different archetypes, and behavior guidelines for each. These personalities Archetypes in pop-culture can have extreme behaviors, so I refined them to ensure they were non-violent, non-abusive, and emotionally healthy. The *sn-api.md* and *sn-user_interface.md* files contain technical information about the Zurich API and ServiceNow AI Platform user interface, which the personas can reference when answering technical questions. The *best-practices.md* file contains guidelines for providing advice, which the personas must follow. The goal was to see if the AI could not only maintain the personality traits of each archetype but also accurately reference the provided technical information when needed. This would demonstrate the AI's ability to blend emotional engagement with factual accuracy, creating a more immersive and reliable user experience.
