**-** Designate a start page for your users, or allow them to choose their own. 

##### Functionality not supported 

##### Important: 

 Connect Chat is not available in Next Experience. Starting with Zurich, certain Connect Chat functions are available in Next Experience by using Sidebar. See KB1123615 – Moving from Connect Chat to Sidebar for more information about the differences between Connect Chat and Sidebar. 

 Connect Support is not available in Next Experience and is scheduled to be completely deprecated in Utah. If you want to automatically assign chat requests and other work items to agents in Next Experience, you must migrate to Advanced Work Assignment and Agent Chat. For details, see Move from Connect Support to Advanced Work Assignment and Agent Chat. 

 These features and products are not currently supported with Next Experience: 

**-** The functionality found in homepages, arranging information from your instance to tell a story     about your data, is found in dashboards on new instances. On upgraded instances with Next     Experience enabled, users can view existing homepages if they have a direct URL, but they     can't create or edit them. Responsive dashboards and Analytics Center dashboards take over     homepage functionality. Use the Homepage deprecation help tool to convert the homepages     on your instance to responsive dashboards. 

**-** Live Feed is not supported. 

**-** The JavaScript console log isn't supported in the Next Experience framework. 

**-** ATF doesn't support these elements of Next Experience, but support for these features is     planned for future releases: 

 ◦ Pages built with UI Builder, including pages with lists and form components. 

 ◦ Configurable Workspaces 

 ◦ Landing pages 

##### Note: ATF still supports the Core UI, including Classic Environment (such as classic lists 

 and forms).

##### View results for your search in an available workspace application 

 If you have access to search in workspace applications, an arrow appears at the right of the Unified Navigation search field after you search that enables you to switch between the results in global search and in your workspace applications. 

 For example, if the context menu in the illustration was available after you performed a global search, you could select CSM/FSM Configurable Workspace from the context menu to view results for the search in CSM/FSM Configurable Workspace. 

 Exact matches open in the selected workspace application. For example, if you selected CSM/ FSM Configurable Workspace , entered a record number, and selected the record preview in the search results, the record would open in CSM/FSM Configurable Workspace. 

 For information adding a workspace to the Unified Navigation search menu, see Add a workspace application to the Unified Navigation search context menu.

 Configuring Next Experience start page options 

 Multiple start page options help you determine where best to start your day in Next Experience. Configure the landing page so that you and your users start on a page tailored to your needs in ServiceNow. 

 There are several options for the page that opens when you launch ServiceNow 

 ® or select the logo at the top of the screen. 

##### Start page options 

 Any page can have redirect rules as the page is loading to take the user to a different page. 

 Next Experience default landing page 

 The default landing page provides information to help orient you to your tasks in an instance enabled with Next Experience. Variants of this page are available, depending on your setup. For more information, see Exploring your Next Experience default landing page. 

 Configurable workspace home 

 Any page within a configurable workspace can be the start page. For more information about configurable workspace options, see Configuring Configurable Workspace.

##### How to choose a start page 

 The different options for start pages serve different purposes. For example, choose a responsive dashboard for your start page if most of your data is in the classic environment, rather than in configurable workspaces. 

##### Upgrade considerations 

 When you upgrade to an instance with Next Experience enabled, it's best to convert homepages to responsive dashboards, so that you don't lose editing capabilities. Homepages are turned

 Next Experience preferences 

 Next Experience offers user preferences to personalize your instance UI. 

 If you have the admin role, you can customize the behavior of Next Experience across your instance by setting global preferences. 

 The Preference modal is divided into three parts: a search field, preference category panel, and a preferences panel that displays the associated preferences for each selected preference category. Once a preference category is selected you see all the preference toggles for that category listed in the Preferences panel. 

 Preference modal 

 As you enter text into the Search field, the Preferences panel dynamically updates to show relevant user preference toggles, organized by category. The search function uses a fuzzy search filter, which finds applicable results even with shortened text. 

 Preference modal Search field 

 The following table shows how you can customize different preference types.

##### Existing customer upgrading instance without UI customization 

 If you're an existing customer, but haven't implemented UI customizations or invested significantly in adopting Workspace, the Next Experience UI is turned on when you upgrade. 

##### Existing customer upgrading instance with UI customization 

 If you're an existing customer who has made any of the following modifications to your instance, you might need assistance from the modification authors, or an established partner, to ensure a seamless activation. 

**-** Customized your user interface. For example, if you created hard-coded styles or implemented     UI scripts. 

**-** Adopted a classic Workspace and want to adopt a new configurable workspace alternative. 

**-** Created custom components in a classic Workspace and want to adopt a new configurable     workspace alternative. 

 You can use the following tools and APIs with your implementation partner to help adjust your customizations to work well with the new Next Experience theme: 

**-** Scriptable PolarisUI API 

**-** Next Experience client scripting globals 

**-** Jelly tags 

##### Existing customer opting out of the Next Experience UI prior to an upgrade 

 If you are an existing ServiceNow customer and decide that you do not want to turn on the Next Experience UI during an upgrade, you can create a system property called 

###### glide.ui.next_experience.opt_out and set the value to true. 

 During the upgrade, the Next Experience UI is not turned on. 

##### Functionality not supported 

##### Important: 

 Connect Chat is not available in Next Experience. Starting with Zurich, certain Connect Chat functions are available in Next Experience by using Sidebar. See KB1123615 – Moving from Connect Chat to Sidebar for more information about the differences between Connect Chat and Sidebar. 

 Connect Support is not available in Next Experience and is scheduled to be completely deprecated in Utah. If you want to automatically assign chat requests and other work items to agents in Next Experience, you must migrate to Advanced Work Assignment and Agent Chat. For details, see Move from Connect Support to Advanced Work Assignment and Agent Chat. 

 These features and products are not currently supported with Next Experience: 

**-** The functionality found in homepages, arranging information from your instance to tell a story     about your data, is found in dashboards on new instances. On upgraded instances with Next     Experience enabled, users can view existing homepages if they have a direct URL, but they     can't create or edit them. Responsive dashboards and Analytics Center dashboards take over     homepage functionality. Use the Homepage deprecation help tool to convert the homepages     on your instance to responsive dashboards.

 Working with themes in Next Experience 

 Themes enable you to tailor the visual experience for your users, helping to update the look and feel to be more like your brand. 

 Quickly create, edit, preview, and publish themes to your experiences using Theme Builder. See Configure Next Experience with Theme Builder for more information. 

##### Important: Theming applies to the classic environment in Lists, Forms, and Dashboards. 

 Custom components don't reflect theming. 

##### Theming at a glance 

**-** Theming is the ability to customize the Next Experience Design System to reflect your product     or brand. 

**-** Theming means styling various aspects of the ServiceNow 

 ® platform while maintaining the overall look and feel. 

**-** Theming typically involves changing the colors to your company brand colors but can also     include typography, imagery, shape and form. 

##### Next Experience default themes 

 New customers launching on Zurich will have the Next Experience Coral theme enabled by default on their instance. 

 Existing customers upgrading from a previous release will continue to see the theme they've applied to their instance prior to upgrade, for example the Next Experience Polaris theme or a theme created in Theme Builder. Use Theme Builder to publish Coral theme to your instance or add Coral theme to the Next Experience UX Parent App Theme table.

 Next Experience default themes 

##### Theme record 

 This image shows the default Polaris theme, which is read-only. You create your own themes and styles to be used by experiences in your instance by either cloning the Polaris or Coral theme or by cloning a Theme Builder theme record. If you clone either the Polaris or Coral theme, you also must clone the styles under UX Theme Styles and make changes to those styles, as desired. At least one Core type style must be defined. 

##### Theme styles 

 You can configure a theme to match your company brand look and feel in ServiceNow. When you configure a theme, you adjust the color schemes, fonts, and images of your applications. On the Theme Builder Theme form, you configure Order, Style, and Type settings. 

© 2025 ServiceNow, Inc. All rights reserved. ServiceNow, the ServiceNow logo, Now, and other ServiceNow marks are trademarks and/or registered trademarks of ServiceNow, Inc., in the United States and/or other countries. 52 


 Order 

 Style records with higher-order values override styles with lower values. The base system styles all have the order 0. If you meet the Applicability constraint, styles with higher values override the base system styles. If not, the lower-value style is used. 

 Style 

 Style records define reusable styles that together comprise a theme. Core styles include color, shape and form, typography, and imagery. Variants are a different version of the theme, commonly different colors, that users can select in preferences. The most common use of variants is for accessibility purposes, particularly to account for color blindness. If you decide to use a dark theme, consider selecting the Polaris or Coral theme or create a dark alternate color palette in Theme Builder. 

 Type 

 Styles can be of either the Core type or the Variant type. Core styles are active by default. Users can choose from available variants from their Theme user preference, and those variant styles override the core style. Theme Builder doesn’t automatically generate dark theme variants; however, you can create a dark alternate color palette with limited customization. For more information, see Add an alternate color palette. The Polaris and Coral themes include a Dark Theme variant that is available on instances with Next Experience enabled.

 Core styles, colors, variants, and alternate color palettes 

 You can tailor the look and feel of the Next Experience UI for different users by configuring the core styles, variants, and alternate color palettes. 

##### Core styles in Theme Builder 

 A core style is the base version of a style. Core styles include color, shape and form, typography, and imagery. 

##### Colors in Theme Builder 

 When editing components, use the color picker to change the background color of the canvas to view how the component colors will render on different backgrounds. 

##### Note: Updating the canvas color doesn't apply to the instance. Only hooks specific to 

 components are applied on the instance if you publish an edited theme to the instance. 

 When editing theme colors, you can view the contrast ratio in the color picker. The value updates when you change the color from the palette or My colors view.

##### Variants/Alternate color palettes in Theme Builder 

 Both variants and alternate color palettes are types of UX style records categorized as Variant. 

 A variant is an alternate version of an existing theme, usually designed for accessibility, that your users can select in preferences. An example of a variant is the Dark version of the default Polaris or Coral theme that is shipped with Next Experience. The Dark variant can be used to enhance accessibility for visually impaired users by replacing light backgrounds with darker ones and contrasting the text colors accordingly. 

 An alternate color palette is a modification that you can make to a theme's colors and is designed for cosmetic purposes. Alternate color palettes allow users to toggle between different visual styles like light and dark options without affecting the core theme. You can define this palette in the Theme Builder Manager page for any theme, except for the default Polaris or default Coral themes. When you use an existing theme to create an alternate color palette, the alternate color palette is grouped with that primary theme, and initially shares its logo, color, typography, and shape styles. At first, the only difference from the primary theme is that you assign it a unique name. 

 Next, you define the primary color for the alternate color palette. This color is used to identify the navigation bar, menus, and other common components. Likewise, define a secondary color, if needed. If your interface doesn't require a secondary color, the primary color is used. Lastly, you define a neutral color to help define divider lines and containers. There are two base palettes available, light and dark. 

##### Note: Secondary and neutral colors cannot be edited in the dark alternate color palette. 

 When the palette is created using the colors you selected, you have the option of renaming it. You can preview all the UI assets available on the ServiceNow AI Platform to visualize how they are rendered when you apply them to your instance. 

##### Note: Dark variants don’t apply to the Core UI, previously referred to as UI16. The Core UI 

 is the interface you use if Next Experience is inactive. However, dark variants extend to most aspects of the Next Experience. 

 Add an alternate color palette 

 Customize a Theme Builder theme by creating an alternate color palette for the theme and publishing it to your instance.

 Working with Global styles 

 Global styles enable you to edit and define core design elements like fonts, colors, and shapes that apply across your entire theme. 

 The Global styles panel is the central workspace for defining the foundational visual elements of your theme. It enables you to configure and preview key design tokens such as color palettes, typography, shape and form, and imagery that apply consistently across your entire experience. 

 The Global styles panel contains five tabs:

 Working with Component styles 

 Component styles enable you to fine-tune the appearance of individual UI elements such as buttons, form controls, and navigation. 

 The Component styles panel provides control over how specific elements like buttons, inputs, and navigation items look and behave across different states such as hover, focus, and disabled. This panel enables tailoring the look of specific UI elements without affecting the broader theme. 

 A search and filter bar at the top of the panel lets you narrow down components by name or category. 

 Each component is represented as a tile and grouped by function such as Navigation, Messaging, Forms. Selecting a component tile opens a side panel with editable properties for that component and its subcomponents.

 Role required: admin 

###### About this task 

 When you're editing a component in Theme Builder, you may encounter a warning symbol 

 ( ), which indicates that the component doesn't comply with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 for color contrast. The WCAG 2.1 contrast ratio that Theme Builder targets for content and UI variables is 3:1. This ratio determines the contrasts between brighter and darker screen colors and how they relate to the user interface. The first digit shows the level of bright colors, and the second digit shows the relative level of dark colors. The 3:1 threshold provides optimal visibility to visually challenged users. For more information, see the W3C Recommendation site for WCAG 2.1.

 Empty state illustrations in Theme Builder 

 Empty state illustrations in Theme Builder provide visually engaging placeholders for situations when content is missing. 

##### Default empty state illustrations 

 When a component or a part of your Next Experience web page doesn’t contain data, an empty state illustration appears. Empty state illustrations are theme-able, and adapt to the theme colors of your instance. 

##### Important: Empty state illustrations apply to Workspaces and are not supported in the 

 Core UI. 

 Example of a default empty state illustration 

 The following are the 16 empty state illustration types, each including a small, medium, and large version:

**-** Offline 

**-** Unconfigured 

##### Custom images 

 Upload your custom images to Theme Builder to replace the default empty state illustrations. 

 To override the default empty state illustrations with custom images, upload each image size individually. You can choose to override just one size or all three sizes of an empty state type. The size and format limitations for each of the three file sizes are as follows: 

 Small image size and format limitations 

 Field Description 

 Dimensions limit w56 x h56 px 

 Format SVG 

 File size limit 2 MB 

 Medium image size and format limitations 

 Field Description 

 Dimensions limit w216 x h168 px 

 Format SVG 

 File size limit 2 MB 

 Large image size and format limitations 

 Field Description 

 Dimensions limit w350 x h318 px 

 Format SVG 

 File size limit 2 MB 

 Empty state illustrations are dependent on two design tokens that handle their color: 

© 2025 ServiceNow, Inc. All rights reserved. ServiceNow, the ServiceNow logo, Now, and other ServiceNow marks are trademarks and/or registered trademarks of ServiceNow, Inc., in the United States and/or other countries. 102 


**-** --empty-state--main-object--fill 

**-** --empty-state--main-object—outline 

 Custom images don't automatically reflect your theme colors. To make your image theme-able, add these tokens to your code using your preferred text editor before uploading the custom SVG to Theme Builder. After adding these tokens to your image code, the images will adopt your theme colors and enable you to edit the colors when uploaded to Theme Builder. 

 The following example shows the design tokens applied. 

 <style> .main-object--outline { fill:rgb(var(--empty-state--main-object--outline, var(--main-object--outline, var(--now-color--interactive-3, 51,53,123)))); } .main-object--fill { fill:rgb(var(--empty-state--main-object--fill, var(--main-object--fill, var(--now-color--interactive-1, 144,146,213)))); } </style> 

 Configure the colors for empty state illustrations and custom images 

 Configure and control the colors automatically applied to empty state illustrations and your custom images to keep your visual experience engaging while maintaining brand recognition. 

###### Before you begin 

 Before you can edit the colors of your custom image, you must append two design tokens to your image code before uploading the image to Theme Builder. For information, see Override empty state illustrations with custom images.

 Working with theme-able empty state images 

 Add theme-able empty state images to customize empty states and improve the user experience. Empty states include guidance or actions for users to add or create content. 

 When a component or a part of your Next Experience web page doesn’t contain data, an empty state image appears. Empty state images are theme-able, and adapt to the theme colors of your instance. 

 Empty state image 

 There are 12 empty state image types available, each including a small, medium, and large version. When creating a theme using Theme Builder a UX Styles Imagery record is created however, the record is empty. In this case, your theme defaults to using a base system empty state theme-able images. If you choose to override these images, see Customize theme-able empty state images for your theme. 

 You can insert an empty state image into your custom experience by using the Illustration component in UI Builder. The Illustration component displays all available empty state images. 

 For more information on the Illustration component, see Horizon Design System Empty State. 

 You can also add custom images using the Custom Illustration component in UI Builder.

 Configuring Next Experience themes and preferences 

 Theming in Next Experience applies to individual experiences. As an admin user, you can configure the variables for colors, shapes, fonts, and other aspects of the user experience. 

 To configure a theme, you create one or more styles with overrides to the default styles. Your new style records override the default Polaris or default Coral style. For example, the default Next Experience font is Lato. To override this font, you would upload a font asset and change the associated font properties in the style that you create. 

##### Note: 

 Usually, you are working with the Compositional Theme. The exceptions are when the experience you are configuring does not have a parent app or it uses an app shell UI other than the Breadcrumb App Shell or the Agent Workspace App Shell. If you are configuring a theme for one of these exceptions, see Manage the visual style of UI Builder experiences. 

 Create a custom theme by cloning a Theme Builder theme record 

 Create a custom theme in the Next Experience more efficiently using a published Theme Builder theme record. 

###### Before you begin 

 In order to clone a Theme Builder theme, the theme must be published. For information on publishing your Theme Builder theme, see Publish your themes with Theme Builder.

###### About this task 

 The Next Experience includes two themes, Polaris and Coral. You can reuse or customize either theme as a starting point when you create or modify your own themes. 

###### About this task 

##### Note: If you're customizing a theme that you created with Theme Builder and enter invalid 

 JSON code, you can't save your theme record. While working in the UX theme record, you can navigate to the Editor page by using the Open in Theme Builder button. For more information, see Manage or edit a theme with Theme Builder. 

###### Procedure 

**1.** Navigate to **All** > **Now Experience Framework** > **Theme Management** > **Themes**. 

**2.** Create a theme record by selecting **New**. 

**3.** Enter a name and a description for your 

 theme. 

**4.** Select the Additional actions icon and select **Save**. 

**5.** On the **Compositional: App Theme** tab, insert rows to add styles that are associated with your     theme.     You assign values in four columns: 

 Applicability 

 Overrides the base theme. Users who meet the applicability constraints see those overrides in their theme rather than the base style. For example, a style with different fonts can be applied to managers. Users who meet the manager applicability see the different fonts in the Next Experience UI, which overrides the base system theme values. Administrators do not have to copy or create an entire theme with changes for the applicable audience. 

##### Note: Leaving the Applicability constraint to empty will apply the style to all 

 users. 

 Order 

 Specifies when the style is applied. The higher the order means that the greater its priority is. 

##### Note: If you want to use a custom style, make sure that your style order 

 number is higher than the standard Polaris or Coral style. 

 Style 

 Configures four main styles. You can't edit the style names that are used in the provided Polaris or Coral themes, but you can copy the JSON code that is associated with each style from either theme and paste and edit it in your custom style's form. 

© 2025 ServiceNow, Inc. All rights reserved. ServiceNow, the ServiceNow logo, Now, and other ServiceNow marks are trademarks and/or registered trademarks of ServiceNow, Inc., in the United States and/or other countries. 142 


 ◦ Colors: Specifies the color properties of the theme and any base variants that you want to add. In the base section of the color style, a subset of the colors that the theme uses are defined with Red, Green, Blue (RGB) values. The theme generates more than 20 gradients of those colors in the application. 

 ◦ Shape and Form: Specifies the look and feel of the borders as well as the buttons and other UI controls. 

 ◦ Imagery: Adds images that are used in your application's theme. 

 ◦ Typography: Specifies the fonts that are used throughout the application. 

 Type 

 Specifies two types: Core and Variant. The Core styles include the color, shape and form, typography, and imagery. Variants specify a different version of the theme, such as the different colors that users can select. The most common variant is a dark version of the theme. The Dark theme is the only variant that is shipped with Next Experience. For more information, see Working with themes in Next Experience. 

**6.** Select the **Style** field and select the lookup icon. 

**7.** Select **New**. 

**8.** Select Primary, Secondary, and Neutral colors. 

##### Note: A theme is made up of multiple variables, so you may notice the default Polaris or 

 Coral theme coloring coming through in different places. 

**9.** When you have your organization's branding colors, navigate to the color generator at https://     theme.deoprototypes.com/color-generator-algo-v1. 

**10.** Select the **Auto Generate** button. 

 A modal pops up and asks you to enter in the three colors from your organization. 

**11.** Enter your hex code values for your organization's colors. 

**12.** Select **Generate**. 

**13.** Gather your CSS variables by selecting **Copy JSON**.

 Configure list record count to load in the background 

 Configure lists created from large tables to load the list record count in the background by using 

###### the glide.ui.fetch.list.record.count.asynchronously property. 

###### Before you begin 

 Role required: admin 

###### Procedure 

**1.** Navigate to **All** > **System Properties** > **All Properties**. 

**2.** Select **New**. 

**3.** On the form, fill in the fields. 

 System Property form 

 Field Description 

 Name The name of your system property as 

###### glide.ui.fetch.list.record.count.asynchrono 

 Description Type a brief, descriptive phrase describing the function of the property. 

 Choices Comma-separated values for a choice list. If you need a different choice list label and value, use an equal sign (=) to separate the label from the value. For example, Blue=0000FF, Red=FF0000, Green=00FF00 displays Blue, Red, and Green in the list, and saves the corresponding hex value in the property value field. 

 Type true I false 

 Value Set the desired value for property. 

 ◦ True to enable this feature. 

 ◦ False to disable this feature. 

 Ignore cache The system stores system property values in server-side caches to avoid querying the database for configuration settings. When you change a system property value, the system always flushes the cache for the sys_properties table. Use this field to determine whether to flush this property's value from all other server-side caches. 

 The default value of false causes the system to not ignore flushing caches, which results in flushing all server-side caches and retrieving the current property value from the database. Set this field to false when you want to ensure all caches have the current property value. The true value causes the system to ignore flushing some server-side caches, which results in only flushing the cache for the sys_properties table and preserving the prior

 Field Description 

 property value in all other caches. Set this field to true to avoid the performance cost of flushing all caches and retrieving new property values. Typically, you should only set this field to true when you have a system property that changes more frequently than once a month, and the property value is only stored in sys_properties table. 

 Private Set this property to true to exclude this property from being imported via update sets. Keeping system properties private prevents settings in one instance from overwriting values in another instance. For example, you may not want a system property in a development instance to use the same value as a production instance. 

 Read roles Define the roles that have read access to this property. 

 Write roles Define the roles that have write access to this property. 

 Application The scope of the feature is enabled Global by default.

 Reflow for Configurable Workspace 

 Reflow enables pages and content to be zoomed up to 400% through your browser settings without loss of content or functionality. 

##### Important: Configurable Workspace pages must use the latest layout system for reflow 

 to be available. For more information, see Upgrading layouts in UI Builder 

 Reflow helps users with low vision or who have trouble seeing web content in a browser due to monitor size, device type, poor lighting, or other situations by transforming page layouts into a vertical, stacked view automatically when users increase browser zoom to 400%. Additionally, content can be enlarged without scrolling in two dimensions at a width equivalent to 320 CSS pixels or a height equivalent to 256 CSS pixels.

 Workspaces include all the tools that agents need to find, research, and resolve issues. ServiceNow provides different workspaces for different issue types. For example, agents using IT Service Management Workspace (ITSM) track and resolve IT issues. Agents using Customer Service Management Workspace (CSM) resolve customer cases, such as sending a piece of computer hardware to fulfill a customer's request. 

##### Key features 

 Single-pane view 

 Agents can see all details that are related to an issue in one place.

 Starting in your Workspace 

 Use workspace to find and resolve internal or external requester issues. 

 The following video shows an example of how to resolve an incident using workspace. 

 Using Agent Workspace 

 Your general workflow using workspace is: 

**1.** Find an issue to work on. 

**2.** Work on the issue to find a solution. 

**3.** Communicate the resolution to the requester. 

##### Next 

 Get started using workspace by working through some tutorials. 

 Learn how to use your Workspace 

 Use the tutorials to walk through many parts of workspace that you will use on a regular basis. 

 The following tutorials are included for you to get a sense of how workspace works: 

**-** Work on issues that are already in the database. 

**-** Work on issues that come in through phone calls or chats. 

##### Note: UI may vary between classic Workspace and UIB Workspace, but the functionality 

 of the features is the same.

 Once you complete both tutorials, you should have a feeling for what workspace does. The topics after the tutorials provide detailed instructions about how to use all of the functionality in workspace. 

 Workspace tutorial for agents starting with a record 

 Perform the steps in this tutorial to get an idea how you can use Workspace when you begin with a task already stored in the database. 

###### Before you begin 

 Role required: agent 

###### About this task 

 Use Workspace to: 

**1.** Find a task to work on. 

**2.** Do research to resolve the task. 

**3.** Communicate the solution to the requester or enter notes for yourself and other agents that     document your progress in finding a solution. 

 The following graphic provides a quick overview of finding and solving an issue. 

© 2025 ServiceNow, Inc. All rights reserved. ServiceNow, the ServiceNow logo, Now, and other ServiceNow marks are trademarks and/or registered trademarks of ServiceNow, Inc., in the United States and/or other countries. 236 


###### Procedure 

**1.** Open your workspace by selecting your Workspace from the Workspace menu. 

##### Note: In the previous image, you can see Agent Workspace Home in the application 

 modules. You can click that to open Workspace. The following steps are for you if you're using a different workspace. 

**2.** Click the name of your workspace and then under Related Links, click **Open workspace**.     Your workspace opens. 

**3.** Log in to your workspace. 

 The first thing to do is find out what to work on. You can do that by looking at what's on the landing page, as shown in this image. Or, you can go directly to the list of open issues to solve. Let's see how to do both. 

**4.** View P1 incidents that haven't been solved by clicking **Open P1 Incidents** on the landing page. 

© 2025 ServiceNow, Inc. All rights reserved. ServiceNow, the ServiceNow logo, Now, and other ServiceNow marks are trademarks and/or registered trademarks of ServiceNow, Inc., in the United States and/or other countries. 237 


 A list of P1 incidents open. 

 This display is called the List view. It's a list of records, in this case, incident records. Normally, you'd click one of the records to open it. Before you do, let's see how else you can start from a list to find a task to work on. 

**5.** Click the list icon ( ) in the left, edge menu.     In the Lists tab, you see the groups of records you can open as lists. For example, you could     open **All problems** or **All change requests**. 

**6.** In the Lists tab, under **Incidents** , click **Open**.     A list of open incidents appears. Let's find out what the problem is and solve it. 

**7.** Click an incident.     The record opens in what is called Record view. 

© 2025 ServiceNow, Inc. All rights reserved. ServiceNow, the ServiceNow logo, Now, and other ServiceNow marks are trademarks and/or registered trademarks of ServiceNow, Inc., in the United States and/or other countries. 238 


 From top to bottom, here's what to notice: 

 ◦ This record is on a tab labeled INC000905. You can open other incidents without closing 

 this one. How? Click the list icon ( ) and click another incident. You can always jump from record to record by clicking the tabs. 

 ◦ The form header shows the record's short description, "Email server is down." The form header is like the title of the incident record. 

 ◦ Underneath that title in the form header is high-level information, including the importance of the task ( Priority ), whether it's been worked on ( State ), and the kind of incident this is ( Category ). 

 ◦ On the bottom, the Details tab shows many details in the record. This section is called the form pane. Notice that you can scroll this section. You can enter information in this section, for example when you get additional information from the requester. 

 Basically, the Activity pane is where you communicate with the requester or make notes to yourself or other agents about your progress in dealing with this incident. On the far side, the Contextual Side panel is where you do your research to find solutions for the task at hand. 

**8.** Click through the tabs next to the **Details** tab to get information related to the open record,     such as the service level agreement (Task SLAs) for this task, continuous integrations (Affected     CIs) that might be affected, services impacted by the incident, related incidents, outages, and     so on.     These items that work like tabs are called the Related items menu. 

**9.** Click **Assign to me** to work on this incident. 

**10.** Scroll down the stack of cards in Agent assist to solve this issue.     The stack of cards is located on the side. If you don't see a card that suggests a solution, you 

 could enter a search term beside the search icon ( ). Notice that workspace automatically entered the value of the Short Description field from the record in the search field and used that to search. 

**11.** Click the card if It looks like the **Reboot Windows Server** card might be the solution that you     want. 

 Agent assist gives you the opportunity to order a reboot. 

**12.** Click **Helpful** to provide guidance to the predictive intelligence software that this was a good     solution for this incident. 

© 2025 ServiceNow, Inc. All rights reserved. ServiceNow, the ServiceNow logo, Now, and other ServiceNow marks are trademarks and/or registered trademarks of ServiceNow, Inc., in the United States and/or other countries. 239 


**13.** Click **Order** to issue a change request to reboot the Windows server.     Notice a new tab appears as a child tab of the same incident tab. These child tabs enable you     to accomplish multiple tasks on one screen. All of the child tabs relate to the same incident,     which is shown on the tab at the top. 

**14.** If you were really solving this issue, you'd click **Submit** and then click the option to save the     change request.     The system would then create the change request, which someone would then perform. 

**15.** Document what you've done. 

 In Activity , in the Compose field, click Comments and enter a note to the requester explaining what you did. 

**16.** Click **Post Comments**.     Workspace sends your comment to the requester and also adds it to the **Activity Stream** ,     which is the history of communications and actions you've taken. 

© 2025 ServiceNow, Inc. All rights reserved. ServiceNow, the ServiceNow logo, Now, and other ServiceNow marks are trademarks and/or registered trademarks of ServiceNow, Inc., in the United States and/or other countries. 240 


**17.** Click **Work notes (Private)** , enter a comment, and click **Post Comments** to save information     that's only seen by fellow agents.     You might use this internal commenting feature if you've not completely resolved an issue but     want to document what you've done for other agents or yourself when you come back to the     issue later. 

**18.** In the form pane, scroll to the section, **Resolution Information** , and do the following. 

 a. In Resolution code , click on one of the choices from the menu, for example, Solved (Permanently). 

 b. In Resolution notes , enter a description of your resolution. 

 c. In Resolved by , select your name. 

 d. In Resolved , select the date and time of the resolution.

 This information becomes part of the record. 

**19.** If you haven't resolved the issue but want to save your progress, click **Save**. 

**20.** If you've resolve the issue, click **Resolved**.     The incident no longer appears in the list of open records.

 Use the landing page to find issues to work on 

 Use the landing page to get an overall view of work that needs to get done. 

###### Before you begin 

 Role required: agent 

###### About this task 

 The landing page is the first page you land on when opening a workspace. It can contain highlevel information, such as unassigned, high-priority tasks, or tasks assigned to you. For example, the following landing page shows unassigned, high priority cases, such as open P1 incidents. The page also shows tasks assigned to you under My Work. 

 Landing pages are configurable by your system administrator so yours might look different. 

###### Procedure 

**1.** Navigate to **All** > **Workspace Experience** > **Workspaces** and click your workspace.     Your landing page opens. 

**2.** Click any of the links on the landing page to select an issue to work on.     If you click a group of records, such as, open P1 incidents, list view opens and you see a list of     P1 incidents that you can choose to work on. If you click the link to a specific record, such as     INC0018313, that record opens in record view. 

###### What to do next 

 Learn how to find work do to in list view. Once you click a record in a list, it opens in record view.

 Using lists to find work to do 

 Use lists in workspace to see high-priority issues and which issues are assigned to you. 

 To get to list view, click the list icon ( ). 

 List view 

 You see two tabs of lists: Lists and My Lists. The system administrator creates the list categories in Lists. You create the list categories in My Lists. 

##### List categories 

 List categories in the previous image are Tasks , SLAs , and Incidents. List categories are not clickable and therefore serve mainly as headings for the list filters beneath them. For example, under the list category, Tasks , are the list filters, My Work and My Group's Work. 

 Your system administrator sets up the list categories, which typically correspond with the tables in the database. For example, all incidents are stored in the incident table. All interactions are stored in the interaction table. The list categories your system administrator chooses to display in list view correspond to the kinds of issues you work on. If you work on incidents, your system administrator shows incidents in the Lists column. If you work on cases, the Lists column shows cases. 

 You can use the up arrowhead icon ( ) to display the list filters under each list category. Clicking 

 the down arrowhead icon ( ) collapses the list categories to make it easier to scroll through the list categories. 

 You cannot have a list category without list filters.

##### List filters 

 List filters are the subsections under list categories. In the previous image, under Tasks , you see My Work and My Group's Work. Each list filter provides a helpful grouping of records typically from one table. For example, My Cases enables you to quickly find cases assigned to you. Your system administrator creates the list filters. 

 Clicking a list filter opens the corresponding list of records in list view. A list filter must belong to a list category in the Lists tab. 

##### My Lists 

 Any lists that you create appear in this section. Lists in this section are only visible to you. For more information about creating your own list categories and list filters, see Create My Lists in workspace. 

##### Next

 Work with lists in workspace 

 Open a list of records in workspace so you can choose one to work on. 

###### Before you begin 

 Role required: workspace_user 

###### About this task 

 List view enables you to see high-level information for all records in a list filter. Normally, clicking a field in a record in a list opens that record. If the field is clickable (a reference, document ID, or URL), clicking it does not open the record, it opens the record or URL that the clickable field points to. 

###### Last refreshed indicates how long ago the values in the list were last refreshed. To refresh 

 the values, refresh the page. 

 Each list has an associated URL. You can bookmark a list to enable quick access to it. 

 Here's how to open a list to find records you want to work on.

###### Procedure 

**1.** Click the list icon ( ). 

**2.** Find a list category that contains the records you want to work on, for example, **Tasks**. 

**3.** Click one of the list filters under it. 

 For example, under Tasks , you might click on a list filter called My Work. That would open up a list of task records assigned to you. The list filter title and the number of records in the list appear at the top of the list. In the previous image, the All list contains 8383 records. 

**4. Optional:** To preview a record before opening it, move your mouse over a record and click the 

 information icon ( ). 

 A side panel opens that shows the record. 

**5. Optional:** To move to a different page of records, click a page number or one of the arrows to     move forward or backwards a page, or to the first or last page of records.

###### What to do next 

 Now that you know how to edit a record in list view, find out how to sort and filter the records displayed in a list. 

 Sort records in lists 

 Sort the records displayed in list view to more easily find the records you want to work on. 

###### Before you begin 

 Role required: agent_workspace_user 

###### About this task 

 Filtered lists can contain thousands of records. Sorting them by field values can help you find the records you want to work on. You can sort the entire list based on any of the columns in the list. 

###### Procedure 

**1.** To change the field the records are sorted by, double click a column heading.     An arrowhead icon ( ) appears to the right of the column heading you clicked and workspace     sorts the list of records based on the values in that column. An arrowhead pointed down     means the values are sorted from highest to lowest values. 

**2. Optional:** To reverse the sorting order, click the arrowhead icon so the arrowhead reverses     direction. 

###### What to do next 

 Instead of sorting records, you might want to Filter records in lists to reduce the number of records displayed in list view.

 Filter records in lists 

 Filter the records to reduce the number of records displayed in list view so you can find the records you want to work on. 

###### Before you begin 

 Role required: agent_workspace_user 

###### About this task 

 Filtering removes records from a list so you can view only those records you're interested in working on. 

 Workspace provides the following ways of filtering records displayed in a list: 

**-** Use the filter icon ( ). 

**-** Filter directly in the list using the column heading. 

**-** Filter directly in the list using the values in the columns. 

###### Procedure 

**1.** To filter out records using the filter icon ( ): 

 a. Click the filter icon ( ). 

 b. Click Advanced View. 

 c. Use the condition builder to specify the conditions one or more field values must meet for a record to appear in the list. For example, [Active][is][true], and [Urgency][is][1High]. 

 d. Optional: To add more conditions, click New condition set and supply a condition. 

 e. Optional: Select Save Filter , enter a filter name, and choose permissions to determine who can use the filter. Retrieve the filter by selecting Use existing filter and select the filter. 

 f. Click Update. 

 The list filter icon shows the number of conditions that apply to the current list. 

**2.** Filter records based on field values displayed.     You can work directly with list columns to filter out records. 

 a. Click the More UI Actions icon to the right of a column heading. 

 b. Click the downward pointing arrowhead icon ( ) and select a filter condition, such as is not , starts with , or contains.

 c. Enter the field value to filter the list on the bottom line and click Apply. In the following example, the only records that appear have Caller values that start with David. 

##### Note: Not all field types support column filtering. You can use the Advanced 

###### Filter panel and condition builder to create a filter for those field types. 

 d. If the values come from the sys_choice table, the possible values (choices) appear with boxes beside them. 

© 2025 ServiceNow, Inc. All rights reserved. ServiceNow, the ServiceNow logo, Now, and other ServiceNow marks are trademarks and/or registered trademarks of ServiceNow, Inc., in the United States and/or other countries. 259 


 If there are more than ten fields, workspace displays a Filter , as shown here, so you don't have to scroll to find a field value. If there are less than ten choices, there's no entry filter under Filter. 

 You can click All to select all of the fields or None to uncheck all of the fields. All selects all of the field values that meet the filter conditions, not just those shown in the pop up. Likewise, None unchecks all of the fields that meet the filter conditions, not just those shown in the pop up. You can combine these functions. For example, you can filter on Windows and select All , and then filter on 2000 and select None and wind up with rows that contain Windows but not Windows 2000. 

 You cannot configure the number of fields (10) that makes the Filter entry field appear. 

 e. Optional: To remove the filter and restore all of the records, click the More UI Actions icon 

 ( ) and click Clear. 

**3.** Filter out records based on field values.     This feature is similar to the one in the previous step but you can't enter a term to filter the     records. 

© 2025 ServiceNow, Inc. All rights reserved. ServiceNow, the ServiceNow logo, Now, and other ServiceNow marks are trademarks and/or registered trademarks of ServiceNow, Inc., in the United States and/or other countries. 260 


 a. Click a field in the record. 

 b. Click the More UI Actions icon ( ). 

 c. To remove all records that don't have the same field value, click Show Matching. 

 d. To remove all records in the list that have the same field value, click Filter Out. By default, a column sorts in an ascending order unless the column data type is a date. Dates sort in a descending order. 

###### What to do next 

 Instead of filtering records, you might like to group records in list view. 

 Group records in lists 

 Group the records displayed in list view to more easily find the records you want to work on. 

###### Before you begin

 Interaction records in Workspace 

 Using an interaction record, agents can create or reference customer information from a customer contact. Agents can then decide if the conversation is an incident, case, or request. 

 An interaction represents a request for assistance made through a chat, phone call, or walkup. Interactions can be routed to queues for assignment or assigned to agents directly. Support agents can create cases, requests, or incidents from the interaction. Interactions can also be used to capture one-and-done type requests where an agent might not want to create associated tasks.

 Working on callback records in your workspace 

 Use Workspace to work on callback records originating from Omnichannel Callback 

##### Overview 

 Omnichannel Callback is a ServiceNow AI Platform 

 ® capability that provides an option for users to opt for a callback instead of waiting in the queue for an available agent. Advanced Work Assignment routes the callback work items to available agents and interaction records are created for each callback work request. The interaction records appear in the Workspace for agents to work on. 

 Agents can work on the records for the following callback scenarios. 

**-** Recurring callback: AWA routes a callback work item to an available agent based on the     predefined callback attempt interval. The agent then receives a **Callback** work item. When     the agent accepts the callback work item, auto-dial initiates a call to the user. Based on the     resolution, the agent can either close the interaction or requeue the callback. 

**-** Click to call: The agent can directly call the end user using the phone icon in the interaction     record if auto-dial is not enabled or the initial call did not succeed. 

**-** Scheduled voice callback: When a user requests a voice callback at their preferred     date and time, an interaction record with callback details is created a minute before     the scheduled call time and an agent receives the callback work item. When the agent     accepts the callback work item, auto-dial initiates a call to the user. Based on the     outcome, the agent can either close the interaction as **Closed Complete** or **Closed** 

 Abandoned. 

**-** Scheduled video callback: When a user requests a video callback at their     preferred date and time, an interaction record with callback details is created

 Getting information related to the open record 

 Use related items to gather information about and to enter information into the open record. 

 The items in the Related items menu behave like tabs. When you click one, the corresponding content appears in the form pane. Workspace underlines the item that's active in the form pane. What items appear in the menu, what order they're in, and which one opens automatically are configurable by your system administrator. 

 The items contain information related to the record open in the form pane. You click the different items to get contextual information. For example, if the open incident is about a failed service, you might click Impacted Services/CIs to see if other services are also down. If the incident is a power outtage, you might click Outages to see if there are outages in other locations. 

 The Details item usually displays first by default. It is the only item that contains details of the open record. It also provides text fields that you can edit. For example, when you solve an issue, you should enter the resolution description in the section, Resolution notes. Your system administrator determines which fields from a record appear in the form pane.

 Your configuration of workspace might include the following related items. 

 Related items 

 Item Description 

 Details Detailed information about the open record and text fields for you to enter information. The system administrator specifies the record fields that appear in the form pane. You use this item to read about the open record and to make entries in the record. 

 Task SLAs Service level agreements (SLAs) for a task. Expected deadlines for resolving a task of this type. 

 Affected CIs Configuration items (CIs) related to an incident. Often, an incident is related to one or more specific configuration items (CIs). If the configuration management database (CMDB) is populated, the CI records hold valuable information to help resolve incidents. You can associate configuration items to an incident to see how the incident affects dependent CIs. 

 Impacted Services/CIs 

 Services and configuration items (CIs) affected by this incident. 

 Child incidents Child incidents are incidents related to the parent incident, the incident open in record view. All work notes or comments in a parent incident are copied into a child incident. When a parent incident is resolved, the child incidents are resolved. 

 Outages Service outages related to the incident open in record view. 

 User's Calls The User’s Calls related list displays historical calls between a requester and Service Desk agents. This feature is available to the users who has the Service Desk Call plugin (com.snc.service_desk_call) already activated. 

##### Note: The customer name in the Opened for field in Interaction 

 is matched with the Caller field in Service Desk calls and records are retrieved based on the number of days mentioned in the interaction property Number of days (integer) for which past user call records are retrieved. The default value is seven (7). A setting of zero (0) disables this feature. 

###### (glide.new_call.interaction.records_age). 

 User's Task When a requester contacts an agent through chat, phone call, request, or walk-in, the User’s Task related list shows the agent all of the other tasks (incident, problem, change request, request, and so on) that have been created for the requester. For example, if a requester calls about the status of a request that was made the previous day, the User’s Task related list shows the request. Workspace includes the other tasks in the User’s Task related list when the value for the Opened for field in the interaction record matches the: 

**- Caller** field in an incident record 

**- Opened by** field in a problem record 

**- Requested by** field in a change record 

**- Requested for** field in a Service Catalog record

 Domain separation for Workspace records 

 Workspace supports standard domain separation. In a record, you can safely create another record in the correct domain, change the domain that the record associates with, and temporarily expand the domain scope of a record to a domain outside the record session. 

 Workspace uses Cross-Tenant Intelligence to automatically handle the data, metadata, business logic, and processing context for tenants that have access to additional tenant data. Crosstenant intelligence enables the following behavior when you create a record. 

**-** Records created from another record inherit the domain of the originating record. 

**-** Records created with a UI action from a record carry over the domain of the originating record. 

**-** Records created from a parent record, for example a related list, carry over the domain of the     parent record. 

 For more information on Cross-Tenant Intelligence in Domain Separation, see What is Domain Separation?. 

 Toggle domain scope of a record 

 Expand the domain scope of a record temporarily to a domain outside the record session. The record expands to include related lists and reference field queries. This enables you to create a main record that applies to issues for more than one domain. 

###### Before you begin 

 You must first have permission to access the domain that you want to toggle. 

 Role required: domain_expand_scope user role 

###### Procedure 

**1.** Navigate to **All** > **Workspace**. 

**2.** Select a record. 

**3.** Click the overflow UI action icon ( ) in the record and select **Toggle Domain Scope**.     You can now access related lists and reference field queries.

 Depending on the issue at hand, you might be ordering a hardware component for a requester, issuing a server restart to solve an issue, or creating and assigning an incident record to remedy a software issue. 

 When you use the landing page or list view to open a record, workspace provides a lot of information about the record. Here's how you might look at the different parts of workspace to understand and resolve an issue. 

**1.** In the Form Header, read the record's short description, priority, status, and issue category. 

**2.** In the Ribbon, read about the requester, how long the issue has been open, and what the SLA     is in solving the issue. 

**3.** In the Form pane, on the **Details** tab, scroll through detailed information about the issue. 

**4.** In the Related Items menu, click the tabs to see information related to the open record, such as     related incidents. The information appears in the Form pane. 

**5.** In the Contextual side panel, read the search results automatically pulled up by Agent assist     that might help solve the issue. 

© 2025 ServiceNow, Inc. All rights reserved. ServiceNow, the ServiceNow logo, Now, and other ServiceNow marks are trademarks and/or registered trademarks of ServiceNow, Inc., in the United States and/or other countries. 308

 You can reply to or forward the email by selecting Reply , Reply All , or Forward. 

##### Note: If you reply, reply all, or forward from the Activity stream, selecting Compose Email 

 in the header causes different UI behavior. For more information, see Communicating with requesters and agents using Compose. 

 Communicating with requesters and agents using Compose 

 You use Compose to communicate with requesters and to enter comments about the work that you do on issues that only fellow agents can read. 

##### Composing comments 

 After researching an issue, you might want to get more information from a requester, communicate a solution, or write an internal note to yourself or other agents to record your progress in solving an issue. To do that, you use the Compose feature. How you enter comments or work notes depends on the configuration. 

**-** If you use a single text field, you select **Comments** or **Work Notes** , enter your comment in the     text field, and select **Post Comments**. 

 Use the Comments text field to communicate with external requesters. Use the Work Notes field to document your progress on an issue. Work notes are not sent to external requesters and are visible only to you and other internal personnel, such as fellow agents who might also work on the issue. 

**-** In stacked view, where there are two text fields, enter text in the appropriate field and select     **Post Comments** or **Post Work notes (Private)**. 

 You can view emails in the Activity Stream. The Email tab appears in Compose when you reply, reply all, or forward an email from an existing email in the Activity Stream. 

 If you configured Compose to use the rich text editor, you can use the icons at the top of the field to stylize the text. With the rich text editor, you can paste an image directly into the text field. 

 When you post your comment in Compose , the comment moves into the Activity Stream, which preserves the entire communication history. Only emails that are user-generated appear, for example existing emails that you write or reply to.

##### Other communications 

 In addition to sending comments to requesters, you can also: 

**-** Use the attachment feature ( ) in the Contextual side panel, for example, to add a knowledge     article to a comment. 

**-** Select the links in some of the cards in Agent assist that, for example, add a knowledge article     to a comment. 

##### Configuring Compose 

 You can configure Compose to appear as a single text field or two text fields. You configure 

 Compose by selecting the configuration icon ( ). 

 You can also view Compose and the Activity Stream side by side to enable you to write work notes and comments while scrolling the activity stream. The Compose UI displays next to the Activity Stream when column space is adjusted to accommodate the side by side UI. You can 

 enable or disable this feature by selecting the configuration icon ( ) and then selecting Side by side. This option appears in the UI when column spacing is wide enough to support side by side (700 pixels or more). This feature may not be supported in older versions of Safari. 

##### Writing Knowledge articles to share solutions 

 To share a solution you've found with the community of workspace users, you can create and publish a knowledge article. The Knowledge Management Service Portal enables users to view knowledge base articles. It is available by default. For more information about creating, editing, and viewing articles, see Knowledge article authoring in Workspace.

 Finding solutions by using Agent assist 

 Find the information that you need to resolve issues by using the Agent assist search engine. 

 Agent assist appears in the Contextual side panel by default and when you select the graduation 

 cap icon ( ). It's possible for you to have icons for more than one Agent assist search engines. If so, each one would search a different set of information sources. 

 When you open a record, Agent assist automatically does a search based on a field in the open record. The field value used for the search term is configurable by your administrator but it's typically the value for the record's short description field. 

 The following example shows the search results for the short description "HDMI port is not working." The search results return as cards. In the following example, the card returned links to an article with the title "HDMI port is not working on my PC" and that was search was last updated 14 days ago. In the following example, you see two different colored graduation caps, which means that the Agent assist search engines are available. 

© 2025 ServiceNow, Inc. All rights reserved. ServiceNow, the ServiceNow logo, Now, and other ServiceNow marks are trademarks and/or registered trademarks of ServiceNow, Inc., in the United States and/or other countries. 331 


 The default number of search results is 10. If more than 10 results are displayed, that number appears as 10+. 

 Agent assist is preconfigured to search the Incident, Problem, Change, Knowledge, and Case tables for solutions. Your administrator can configure Agent assist to search the additional information sources, such as the service catalog. 

 You can use Agent assist in the following ways to find solutions to the record that you opened: 

**-** Select a card to go to the search result. 

 The search result might provide the answer you need, which you can then send to the requester by using the Compose editor in Activity stream. 

**-** Enter a new search term in the search field next to the search icon ( ) to get different search     results.

###### Before you begin 

 Role required: admin 

###### About this task 

 The following procedures describe functions that users can configure or use with lists. 

 Sort a list 

 You can quickly find information in a list by sorting the list. The method that the system uses to sort a list depends on the type of record in the sort column. 

###### Before you begin 

 Role required: none 

###### About this task 

 Consider the example record: Label= Requested Item ; Value= sc_req_item. Field types other than choice list types are sorted based on the label. The example record label, Requested Item , would be sorted with records whose labels start with "r." 

 A choice list field lets the user select from a pre-defined set of choices. Choice list fields are sorted by the underlying dictionary entry value of the field, not by the label. The example record value, sc_req_item would be sorted with records whose values start with "s." 

 Sorting by value can be useful. For example, choices for the State of tasks are ordered New > Work in Progress > Closed. Based on the label, the sort would be Closed > New > Work in Progress. 

 An arrow next to the column name indicates the current sort order. A downward pointing arrow indicates that the column is sorted in descending order. Only the primary sort order is indicated. 

##### Note: The following sorting rules apply to lists: 

**-** In a translated instance, only translated_text, translated_field, and translated_html type     columns support sorting. 

**-** The column label should be created in English first then translated accordingly. 

**-** You cannot sort a list by an array-based field, such as a Glide list. 

 To sort a list, use one of the following methods:

###### Procedure 

**-** Click a column name to sort the list in ascending order.     Click again to sort in reverse order. 

**-** Right-click a column name and select **Sort (a to z)** or **Sort (z to a)** to sort in ascending or     descending order, respectively. 

**-** Specify a sort order with a filter.     Filters provide for sorting by more than one column (for example, by Category and then     Subcategory).

 Search a list 

 You can search a list to find information quickly. The list title bar includes options for searching the list. Administrators can enable text searches for any list. 

###### Before you begin 

 Role required: none 

###### About this task 

 There are two options for searching the list: for a string in a selected field, or for a text string found in any field. These options are labeled Go to and Search. 

© 2025 ServiceNow, Inc. All rights reserved. ServiceNow, the ServiceNow logo, Now, and other ServiceNow marks are trademarks and/or registered trademarks of ServiceNow, Inc., in the United States and/or other countries. 372 


**-** The **Go to** option sorts the list by the selected field and returns records where the field value     is equal to or greater than the search term. For the **Number** field, which is a string type field,     it finds the records that have a number ending with the number that you enter. For example,     searching a list of incidents by selecting **Number** and entering 4 shows records with numbers     like **INC0000004** and **INC0000014**. 

**-** The **Search** option appears when you select **for text**. It returns records that contain the search     term in any field in the list table. If you added a related list condition, the search does not     include records in the related table. 

 Each option in a choice list is defined with a column label and a value. For example, the incident State field contains several options, such as New and Closed. These labels are column labels, and each one has an underlying value. For incidents, the default value for New is 1 and the default value for Closed is 7. You can search a column for either the column label or the value with the following results. 

**-** Enter the column label to list matching records, for example, all incident records in the **New**     state. 

**-** Enter the value to find records that have a state greater than or equal to (=>) the specified     value. For example, enter **6** to list incident records in the **Resolved** and **Closed** states. 

###### Procedure 

**1.** Navigate to a list of records. 

**2.** If necessary, personalize the list to add the desired fields. 

**3.** Select a field or select **for text**. 

**4.** Enter the search text.     Use wildcards to further refine list searches. 

**5.** Press the Enter key to execute the search. 

 Available list search wildcards 

 The platform supports several wildcard characters to expand and refine search results. 

 Available list search wildcards 

 Wildcard Description 

 *search-term 

 %search-term% 

 Search for values that contain search-term. 

 %search-term Search for values that end with search-term. 

 search-term% Search for values that start with search-term. 

 =search-term Search for values that equal search-term.

 Available list search wildcards (continued) 

 Wildcard Description 

 !*search-term Search for values that don't contain search-term. 

 !%search-term Search for values that start end with search-term. 

 !=search-term Search for values that don't equal search-term. 

##### Note: Reference fields support a different set of wildcard operators. For details on using 

 wildcards to search reference field auto-complete values, see Auto-complete for reference fields. 

 Configure the default search behavior 

 The default search behavior in a list is to search for values that are greater than or equal to the value you enter. Administrators can add properties to change the search behavior to use either a contains search or a starts with search by default, instead of a greater than search. 

###### Before you begin 

 Role required: admin 

###### About this task 

 If you enter text in the search box without using a wildcard, the search is performed for values greater than or equal to the value you enter. For text data-type-fields, this means that the search first sorts the records on the selected field, then finds the first record that starts with the text and all following records. For numeric data-type-fields, this means that the search finds all records where the number field ends with the entered number. 

##### Note: The system treats some string fields that contain record numbers as numeric fields. 

###### Any field named number or u_number is treated as a numeric field. 

###### Changing the default search behavior to contains or starts with can cause performance 

 issues as both search options return more results than a greater than search. 

###### Procedure 

**1.** Navigate to the list of system properties by typing sys_properties.list into the     navigation filter. 

**2.** Add one of the following properties depending on your default search behavior preferences. 

 Default search behavior property 

 Name Description 

###### glide.ui.goto_use_contains Changes the default search behavior for a list 

###### to a contains search. 

 ◦ Type: true | false 

 ◦ Value: true 

###### glide.ui.goto_use_starts_with Changes the default search behavior for a list 

###### to a starts with search. 

 ◦ Type: true | false 

 ◦ Value: true

 A filter is a set of conditions applied to a table to help you find and work with a subset of the data in that table. 

 You can apply, modify, create, and save filters. A hierarchical list of conditions at the top of the table — breadcrumbs — indicates the current filter. 

 Breadcrumbs offer a quick form of filter navigation. They are ordered from left to right. The left condition is the most general, and the right condition is the most specific. Clicking a breadcrumb removes all the conditions to its right. Clicking the condition separator (>) before a condition removes only that condition. 

 By default, a user with no roles cannot see the breadcrumbs or filter. Administrators can configure the ESS portal to allow unauthenticated users to see breadcrumbs and filters by using a script include. For more information on using script includes to suppress breadcrumbs and filters, see Use script includes to suppress filters and breadcrumbs. 

 Breadcrumbs, List v2 

 Examples: 

**-** Clicking **Priority = 2** removes the condition **Category = Software** and returns all active     incidents with a priority of 2. 

**-** Clicking the condition separator (>) before **Priority = 2** removes the condition **Priority = 2** and     returns all active incidents in the software category. 

**-** Clicking **All** removes all conditions and returns all incidents in the system. 

 Click a breadcrumb to refresh the list of records and show the latest information for those records.

##### Note: Clicking the New button in a filtered list automatically applies the same filter to 

 the new record. For example, clicking New in the Resolved Incidents list opens a record preset with State set to Resolved. In a list filtered for active, priority 1 incidents, clicking New opens a record preset with Active selected and Priority set to 1 Critical. 

 You can change the preset values on the form as needed. If there is a field you do not want to have populated in this way, you can add the following dictionary attribute to the field: 

###### ignore_filter_on_new=true. 

 Additional navigational functions are available when you right-click a breadcrumb. 

 Breadcrumb right-click options 

 Option Description 

 Open new window 

 Opens the results list for the breadcrumb in a new tab or window. 

 Copy URL 

 Copies the URL to the clipboard for the results list of the breadcrumb. Follow browser instructions if browser security measures restrict this function. 

 Copy query 

 Copies the encoded query to the clipboard for the breadcrumb. You can use this query in the URL of an instance or in the reference qualifier field of a dictionary entry. 

 For example, if you are viewing a list of all active incidents with a high or medium impact, right-click the breadcrumb and copy the query active=true^impact=1^ORimpact=2. You can append this query to the end of the instance URL as follows: 

 https://{instance_name}/incident_list.do? sysparm_query=active=true^impact=1^ORimpact=2 

 This selection is not available for the All breadcrumb.

 Quick filters 

 To quickly filter a list using a value in a field, right-click in the field and select Show Matching or Filter Out. For date fields, choose from Show Before , Show After , and Filter Out. 

 These functions add a condition to the right in the breadcrumb of the current filter.

 Quick filter 

 In this example, right-clicking In Progress and selecting Show Matching adds the condition State = In Progress as the most specific condition of the filter. By contrast, right-clicking In Progress and selecting Filter Out adds the condition State != In Progress as the most specific condition of the filter. 

 For date and date-time fields, you can also use Show After or Show Before to define a timebased filter. 

 Using the quick filter method to filter out a particular value builds the following conditions: [field] [is not] [value] or [field] [is] [empty]. Records that contain empty or null values still display in the filtered list. If you manually create a filter, it does not automatically include the OR condition [field] [is] [empty], so records that have an empty or null value do not display in the filtered list. 

 Filters 

 A filter restricts what records appear in a list by providing a set of conditions each record must meet to be included in the list. 

 A condition consists of the following parts. 

**-** Field: Each field contains data from a particular column in the table. Selecting a reference field     enables you to dot-walk to data from other tables. 

**-** Operator: Each field type has its own set of valid operators. The operator determines if a value     is needed. 

**-** Value: Each field has its own set of valid values determined by the field type. Reference fields     have access to auto-complete, and choice lists provide a list of options. 

**-** Grouping: Each condition line is grouped with either an AND or OR connector. The filter     requires all condition lines linked with an AND connector to be met. The filter separately     evaluates each condition line linked with an OR connector. 

 List v3 provides the Related Lists Conditions section that enables you to include a condition based on a related table. 

##### Note: If you open a list for a table you have create permissions for, apply a filter for a field, 

 and click New in the list header. The same field is automatically populated with the value you set in the filter on the new record.

##### Related list conditions in List v3 

 By default, all lists enables you to filter on the current table data, which includes dot-walking to fields in referenced tables. In v3 lists, another type of condition, Related Lists Conditions, is available in the condition builder. For more information, see Add related list conditions. 

##### Pin a filter in List v2

 Create a filter in List 

 You can create a filter to restrict what records appear in a list by providing a set of conditions. When you run the filter, only records that meet the specified conditions are listed. 

###### Before you begin 

 Role required: none 

###### Procedure 

**1.** Open the condition builder by clicking the show/hide filter icon ( ).     If the icon is disabled and the breadcrumb has a related list condition in it, you must remove     the related list condition to open the filter. The condition was created when the List v3 was     enabled for this list. List v2 does not support related list conditions. For more information about     related list conditions, see Add related list conditions. 

**2.** Select a field from the list.     The field type determines the available operators and values. For example, the **Active** field     can have a value of **true** , **false** , or **empty** , while a text field can have many different values.     Similarly, the **greater than** operator does not apply to the **Active** field, but it does apply to the     **Priority** field. For more information, see Condition builder. 

**3.** Select an **operator** from the list. 

**4.** Select or enter a **value** , if appropriate. 

**5.** Add or remove conditions to construct the desired filter by completing one or more of the     following steps. 

 Option Description 

 To add a top-level condition 

 Click AND or OR on the condition builder tool bar, above the conditions. 

 To add a dependent condition Click AND or OR beside the condition. 

 To remove a condition Click x beside the condition. 

##### Note: To find all records that do not contain the specified value, create a filter with two 

 conditions: [field] [is not] [value] or [field] [is] [empty].

 Add related list conditions 

 Related list conditions allow you to include a relationship with another table in the filter. Related list conditions are supported in both List v3 and the Report interface. 

###### Before you begin 

 Role required: none 

###### About this task 

 You can optionally include conditions on the related table. For example, you can filter active problems with one or more related incidents that are in the Canceled state. Another example is to filter incidents with a breached service level agreement (SLA). 

 The List v3 filter contains two sections, one for the current table conditions and one for related lists conditions. You can include only one related table in the query, however, you can add multiple conditions for that table. 

 Problem filter for open problems 

 The easiest way to understand the parts of a related list condition is to use an example. The steps below use the example of open problems with some number of related incidents. You can perform these steps for any list view that supports List v3.

###### Procedure 

**1.** For this example, navigate to **Problems** > **Open**. 

**2.** Open the list filter and select the conditions for the current (Problem) table.     The **[State] [is] [Open]** condition is already added. 

**3.** Select **RELATED LISTS CONDITIONS** to expand the section. 

**4.** From the choice list, select the table relationship to include in the query.     For this example, select **Incident>Problem**. You can select any table that you have access to     view. 

**5.** To select a quantifier, select **Greater Than Or Equal To 1**.     The Quantity popover opens. 

**6.** Select a quantity, enter number of records in the related table that must match, and then     select **X** to close the popover.     The default number is **1**. Following are descriptions and examples of each quantifier for this     example. 

 ◦ Greater Than Or Equal To : Returns problem records where the number of related incidents is greater than or equal to the number you enter. A value of 5 includes problems with five or more related incidents. Problem records with 4 or fewer incidents are not returned. 

 ◦ Greater Than : Returns problem records that have more than this number of related incidents. 

 ◦ Less Than Or Equal To : Returns problem records that have the number or fewer than the specified number of related incidents. A value of 1 includes problem records with one or no related incidents. 

 ◦ Less Than : Returns problem records with fewer than the number of related incidents. A value of 1 returns problems with no related incidents. 

 ◦ Equal To : Returns problems with this number of related incidents. A value of 5 includes problem records with exactly five related incidents. 

 ◦ None : Returns problems that do not match the specified table relationship. A selection of None returns problems with no related incidents. 

 ◦ Between : Returns problems with any number of related incidents that is between the two numbers you enter. Between values of 5 and 10 include problem records with 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 related incidents. 

**7. Optional:** Enter one or more conditions for the related table.     Select **New Criteria** to add another condition. 

 Example The following image shows the example of filtering for problem records with more than two related incidents that are critical priority.

##### Note: If List v3 is disabled for a list with a related list condition query in the default filter, 

 the filter edit function is disabled. Remove the related list condition to enable list filter editing. 

 OR conditions 

 The condition builder uses two different types of OR conditions: top-level and dependent. 

 Using a dependent OR condition, you can specify alternative criteria to a single operation. Dependent OR conditions work in the manner A and (B or C). When you have an OR condition in the query, the magnifying glass is no longer available. The conditions you put in the quick search headers are ANDed together. Having an OR makes it ambiguous as to where the new condition should go, for example before the OR, or after the OR. 

 For example, to return a list of all unassigned problem and incident records from the Task table, create a filter with a dependent OR on the Number field.

 [Assigned to] [is] [empty] AND [Number] [begins with] [PRB] OR [Number] [begins with] [INC]. 

 Dependent OR 

 A top-level OR condition allows you to display the results of multiple filter criteria in a single list. Top level OR conditions work in the manner (A and B) or (C and D). 

 For example, to return a single list of all active incidents with a category of hardware, and all inactive incidents with a category of software, create two condition sets separated by a top-level OR condition. 

**- [Active] [is] [true]** AND **[Category] [is] [Hardware]** 

**-** Top level OR condition 

**- [Active] [is] [false]** AND **[Category] [is] [Software]** 

 Top level OR

 Top-level and dependent OR conditions can be used together. Filters using both types of OR conditions work in the manner (A or B) or (C or D). By mixing AND conditions with top-level and dependent OR conditions, you can create very specific filters. 

 Filter on multiple string values 

 For a string field, you can create a filter that searches for multiple values by creating a commadelimited list. 

###### Before you begin 

 Role required: admin 

###### About this task 

 This feature enables administrators to copy and paste search criteria from a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet into a filter, for example. 

##### Note: Do not use the [is one of] operator on fields that contain commas, as the query 

 does not return the expected set of records. Instead, create a filter using multiple [or] statements. 

###### Procedure 

**1.** Create the filter with the **[is one of]** or **[is not one of]** operator.     Depending on the selected field, a choice list or a text box appears. 

**2.** Select one or more of the options by using multiple selection key commands. 

 The choice list remains visible. 

 Alternatively, for text or number fields, type your search options. Separate the options by commas or put each option on a separate line, and do not enclose the selections in brackets. 

**3.** Click **Run** to filter the list.

 Create scripted filters 

 The condition builder alone cannot create some filters, such as displaying a record set that depends on an unrelated table. If you know JavaScript, you can create JavaScript functions for use in advanced filters. 

###### Before you begin 

 Role required: admin 

###### Procedure 

**1.** Create a new script include. 

 a. Navigate to All > System Definition > Script Includes. 

 b. Click New. 

 c. Fill out the form, and then select Submit. 

**2.** Open the script include and, in the **Script** field, create a JavaScript function that returns an     array of sys_ids. 

 ◦ Ensure that the function uses the same name as the script include. 

 ◦ Ensure that the script include is Active and Client callable. 

**3.** Call the JavaScript function from the condition builder.     For more information, see GlideRecord queries and Script includes. 

##### Note: Grouped lists with a script include in the filter may cause slowness. 

###### Example: 

 A company provides intensive care for a group of customers. To track these services, the service manager needs a high-level journal and links to all incidents that the customers raise. The company creates an application, Intensive Care, and a table, [u_intensive_care]. While the table contains a reference field for the customer name, there is no direct link to the user table. Thus, the manager cannot set up an incident list filter using the condition builder for customers who are under intensive care. 

© 2025 ServiceNow, Inc. All rights reserved. ServiceNow, the ServiceNow logo, Now, and other ServiceNow marks are trademarks and/or registered trademarks of ServiceNow, Inc., in the United States and/or other countries. 389 


 The solution is to write a JavaScript function that uses a GlideRecord query to build an array of user sys_ids in the [u_intensive_care] table, as shown in the sample code below. Call the function from the condition builder in the Incident table ( [Caller] [is] [javascript:myFunction()] ). 

 function myFunction(){ var arrUsers = []; var gr = new GlideRecord('u_intensive_care'); gr.query(); while(gr.next()){ arrUsers.push(gr.u_customer.toString()); } return arrUsers; } 

 Create a dynamic filter option 

 Dynamic filter options enhance filtering by allowing users to run existing script includes or JavaScript against a reference field within condition builders and dynamic reference qualifiers. 

###### Before you begin 

 Role required: admin 

###### About this task 

 This task describes how to create a new dynamic filter option and an associated script include. 

 Dynamic filter options "objectize" script includes/JavaScript, enabling them to be reused in 

 multiple condition builders and dynamic Reference qualifiers. This type of filter enables you to modify a script once and have the changes automatically take effect everywhere the dynamic filter option is used. 

 When defining a dynamic filter, you can: 

**-** use an existing **is (dynamic)** dynamic filter option (condition builder only) 

**-** use an existing dynamic filter option (OOB or custom) 

**-** create a new dynamic filter option and script include/JavaScript 

 All condition builder dynamic filters use the is (dynamic) operator and call a dynamic filter option. In the following example, the pre-existing dynamic filter option Me is being used. For a list of available pre-existing condition builder dynamic filter options, see Dynamic operators. 

##### Note: Dynamic filters are supported in scoped applications, but they are not supported in 

 UI policy conditions. 

 Dynamic operands 

###### Procedure 

**1.** Create a scripted filter as a client-callable script include or business rule. 

**2.** Navigate to **System Definition** > **Dynamic Filter Options**.

**3.** Select **New**. 

**4.** Complete the form. 

 Dynamic filter options 

 Field Description 

 Label Enter a descriptive name for the dynamic filter option. 

 Script Enter the name of the function you created, JavaScript (no script include needed), or the complete script include/business rule call, such as new GlobalCanvasUtil().refQualPaTabs(). 

 Field type Select Reference. 

 Referenced table 

 Select the table to which this dynamic filter option applies. 

 Order Enter a number to designate the placement of this dynamic filter option in the filter option choice list. 

 Roles Select the role a user must have to see this option. 

 Active Enable or disable the option. 

 Reference script 

 Optional. Select the client-callable script include or business rule you created for the scripted filter. If the Script field contains JavaScript, an encoded query, or the entire script include/business rule reference, this field can be empty. 

 Available for filter 

 Select this option to display the dynamic filter option as a filter breadcrumb. 

 Available for default 

 Select this option to allow dynamic filter option to be a default in a dictionary entry. 

 Available for ref qual 

 Select this option to allow dynamic filter option to be selected as a dynamic reference qualifier. 

##### Note: Dynamic filters using Table API GET methods in scripts only work when using the 

 same user configured in the basic authentication profile. To allow multiple users access to the dynamic filters, use global JavaScript APIs such as GlideRecord and GlideQuery APIs instead. 

**5.** Select **Submit**. 

 Encoded query strings 

 An encoded query string represents a complex filter on a list of records. 

 Use encoded query strings to include a filter as part of a URL parameter, such as the Navigate to a record or module using a URL, or as a reference qualifier to restrict the data that is selectable for a reference field. 

 To construct an encoded query string, generate a list query and then copy it from the list filter. This is the preferred method because the alternative is to create the string manually. 

 In order to create an encoded query string manually, you need to know the relevant table and field names and operators.

 Encoded query string examples 

 Title Example 

 Referring to Boolean or string values 

 To create a query string on Boolean fields, use this syntax: field=true or field=false. For example, to return only active records in a table, use: 

 active=true 

 To create a query string with a field that has a specific string value, use this syntax: field=value. For example, to return incident records where the category is network, use: 

 category=network 

 Referring to reference fields 

 To create a query string that refers to a reference field in another table, use this syntax: field_in_referenced_table=value. For example, to return users with the itil role in the Assigned to reference field on the Incident form, use: 

 Assigned_to.roles=itil 

 Referring to choice list values 

 To create a query string that refers to a choice list option, use the value of the choice list, not the label, with this syntax: choice list field=value. For example, to return configuration items (CIs) with the status Installed , which has a value of 1 in the choice list, use: 

 install_status=1 

 See Values to associate with choice labels for scripting to find the options for the values. 

 Using multiple conditions 

 To use two conditions joined by an AND operator, use the carat ^ symbol in this syntax: field1=value1^field2=value2. For example, to return all active users with the "itil" role, use: 

 active=true^roles=itil 

 To use two conditions joined by an OR operator, use the carat symbol with OR with this syntax: field1=value1^ORfield1=value2. For example, to return all users with either the "itil" or "admin" roles, use: 

 roles=itil^ORroles=admin 

 To use condition by the LIKE operator, use the syntax:fieldLIKEsubstring. For example, to return all users with roles containing the string "it", use: 

 rolesLIKEit 

 To use condition by an IN operator, use the syntax: fieldINvalue1,value2,value3. For example, to return all users with roles that are either "itil", "admin", or "user", use: 

 rolesINitil,admin,user 

 To add multiple conditions where one condition is a JavaScript function, use this syntax: javascript:'field=value^' + function(). The function must return a string that can be concatenated with the first string to produce a valid query

 Encoded query string examples (continued) 

 Title Example 

 string. For example, to return all active users and meet the conditions of the getGroupQualifier() function, use: 

 javascript:'active=true^' + getGroupQualifier() 

 Listing values in order 

 To sort data by a specific field, use the ORDERBY condition with the following syntax: field1=value^ORDERBYfield2. 

 For example, to return the days of the week in order from the Day of the Week [sys_cal_unit] table, use: 

 unit_name=day^ORDERBYvalue 

 In the Day of the Week table, unit_name is the field that specifies day, week, or month, and value is a numerical value for each day from 1 (Monday) to 7 (Sunday). The query string returns a list of the days of the week in order from the lowest value, which represents Monday, to the largest value, which represents Sunday. 

##### Note: Reference qualifiers do not support the ORDERBY condition. In 

 reference qualifiers, you can sort the reference lookup list by using standard list controls. To specify the order of an auto-complete list for a reference field, use the ref_ac_order_by dictionary attribute. 

 Including a related list query 

 At the end of the query statement, enclose the related list information with ^RLQUERY and ^ENDRLQUERY and the quantity. For example, in a query on the Problem table that includes problems with at least one related incident, use: 

 ^RLQUERYincident.problem_id,>=1^ENDRLQUERY 

 You can also specify conditions on the related table. For example, to include the condition that at least one of the related incidents is critical priority, use: 

 ^RLQUERYincident.problem_id,>=1^priority=1^ENDRLQUERY 

##### Note: Related list queries must be enabled in System Properties List v3. 

 Select the Allow related list query conditions to be added through the filter check box to enable it. 

 You can build a related list query for a list that uses List v2, however, the filter conditions cannot be modified until you removed the related list condition in the breadcrumb. 

 Including a search term query 

 To include a search term in a query, use the 123TEXTQUERY321 reserved variable. For example, to return results with the 'email' search term, use this encoded query string. 

 123TEXTQUERY321=email 

 Including a text index group query 

 To include a text index group in a query, use the 123TEXTINDEXGROUP321 reserved variable. For example, to return results within the portal_index_group text index group in the Text Index Groups [ts_index_group] table, use this encoded query string.

 Generate an encoded query string through a filter 

 You can generate an encoded query string through a filter on any list and paste the string into a URL query or a reference qualifier. 

###### Before you begin 

 Role required: none 

###### Procedure 

**1.** Open a list of records. 

**2.** Construct the filter. 

**3.** Click **Run**. 

**4.** Right-click the end of the filter breadcrumb and select **Copy query** from the context menu.

###### About this task 

 The list editor lets you edit field values in a list without opening a form. Administrators can configure the list editor. By default, list editing is disabled for some tables. Fields of certain types cannot be edited from lists. 

 Before the list editor opens, access rights to edit the field are verified. If this process takes longer than expected, a loading indicator appears. If the field has a dependency relationship (for example, Category and Subcategory), then a composite editor opens to enable editing of all dependent fields. You must have permissions to edit all dependent fields to use the list editor. 

###### Procedure 

**1.** Double-click in an empty area of the field.     The appropriate editor for the field type opens. 

##### Note: You can enable single-click editing from the list personalization interface. You can 

 also use keyboard navigation to access the list editor. 

**2.** Enter the appropriate values.     To clear a list field configuration, refresh your browser session by reloading the page, and the     original list field configuration returns. 

**3.** Save the records by performing the appropriate action for your list version. 

 Select the save icon ( ). Select the cancel icon ( ) or press the Escape key to retain the original value.

 Edit multiple records in a list using an editing form 

 You can edit multiple records at the same time using an editing form. If you want to edit multiple fields or fields that don’t appear in the list view, use an editing form. 

###### Before you begin 

 Role required: list_updater 

 Depending on your ACL settings, some of these options might not be available even with the right role. For example, if the list is task.list and users try to select multiple incident records from that task list, the form uses the task form and not the incident form so ACLs on task are enforced instead. Since users would not have access to tasks specifically, the form wouldn’t show any fields. 

###### Procedure 

**1.** Perform one of the following actions. 

 Option Description 

 Update selected records 

 a. Select the check box by each row that you want to edit. 

 b. Select and hold (or right-click) any column header and select Update Selected.

##### Note: 

 ◦ Values in the first column appear as links. If the first column isn’t a reference field, the link opens the record from the list, as expected. If the first column is a reference field, the link opens the record from the referenced table. This behavior can be confusing. For this reason, avoid using a reference field as the first column. 

 ◦ If an inactive field is removed from an admin-configured default view, any personal lists will reset to follow the default view, thus removing the inactive field from the personal list.

 Embedded list 

 Related lists 

 Related lists appear on forms and show records in tables that have relationships to the current record. 

 Users can view and modify information in related lists like any other list. Administrators can configure related lists to appear on forms and in hierarchical lists by configuring a form. Related lists do not have a size limit. 

##### Note: 

 Creating a record using a related list applies the list filter to the record and auto-populates the related field. This behavior applies to reference, string, Boolean, and menu fields when the criteria in the filter is set to is or =.

###### About this task 

 For example, you may include a list of related incidents at the bottom of a problem record, or a list of members at the bottom of a group record. This functionality depends on reference fields or many-to-many table relationships. If two tables are related via the system dictionary, one can appear as a related list on the other. 

 Defined related lists allow relationships between arbitrary tables to be expressed as a related list. Any two tables that can have a logical relationship can appear as a parent/child pair via a related list. The following are some examples. 

**-** On an incident record, show all incidents opened by the same caller. 

**-** On a user record, show the last 20 transactions that user has made. 

**-** On an incident record, show all problems opened on the reported CI. 

 These relationships are beyond the relationships normally defined in the system dictionary through reference fields and many-to-many relationships. 

 Every related list requires a relationship record. Before creating a relationship, verify that there is not an existing relationship record that already provides the needed information. Use the following steps to create a relationship record. 

###### Procedure 

**1.** Click **System Definition** > **Relationships**. 

**2.** Click **New**. 

**3.** Specify the relationship record fields. 

 Relationship record fields 

 Field Description 

 Name Type the name of the related list. The form configuration page displays this name in the list of available lists. 

 Advanced Select this check box to use JavaScript in place of the Applies to table and Queries from table fields. 

 Applies to table 

 Select the table on which the related list appears. 

 For example, to add a related list to the user form, select the User [sys_user] table. 

 This field is hidden in Advanced relationship records. 

 Queries from table 

 Select the table from which this related list retrieves data. 

 For example, to add related task records to the related list, select the Task [task] table. 

 This field is hidden in Advanced relationship records. 

###### Apply to Type a script that sets the answer variable to true when a user opens a form on 

 the desired table. This field is only visible with the Advanced check box selected. 

 Query from 

###### Type a script that sets the answer variable to the name of the table from which 

 the related list retrieves data. This field is only visible with the Advanced check box selected.

 Field Description 

 Query with 

 Specify the records to include by typing a script. 

 For example: 

 current.addQuery('opened_by', parent.sys_id); 

 ◦ The current object specifies the current record on which the script is triggered. 

 ◦ The addQuery method adds a filter that returns records meeting a specified condition. 

 ◦ The opened_by variable is the field name you're querying in the table from Queries from table. 

 ◦ The parent.sys_id variable refers to the Applies to table and the ID of the record being displayed. 

 Insert Callback 

 Type a script to run after a successful insert action. This field is only visible with the Advanced check box selected. 

**4.** Click **Submit**. 

 Add incidents by same caller related list 

 This example adds the existing relationship, Incidents by Same Caller, to incident forms. 

###### Before you begin 

 Role required: admin 

###### About this task 

**- Applies to table** : This list appears as an available related list when viewing an incident record. 

**- Queries from table** : This list displays a list of incidents. 

**- Query with** : This script selects records where the **caller_id** matches the **caller_id** of the parent     record (the incident you are viewing). 

###### Procedure 

**1.** Open an incident. 

**2.** Right-click the header and select **Configure** > **Related Lists**.

 The name of the existing relationships appears in your list of available lists. 

**3.** Move the **Incidents by Same Caller** list to the **Selected** list. 

**4.** Click **Save**. 

###### What to do next 

 Notes and limitations: 

**-** Creating a record using a related list applies the list filter to the record and auto-populates the     related field. This behavior applies to reference, string, Boolean, and menu fields when the     criteria in the filter is set to **is** or **=**. 

**-** For example, if you click the **New** button on one of these new relationships, the system     attempts to ensure that the new record matches the list conditions. For example, clicking     **New** on the example list results in an incident where the **caller_id** is pre-populated with **Bud**     **Richman**. 

**-** When scripting your condition, **current** is the record to which you want to add queries while     **parent** is the main record being displayed. 

**-** These relationships do not refresh until you update a form. In the example, if you changed the     caller from **Bud Richman** to **Fred Luddy** , the list at the bottom of the screen still displays the     incidents belonging to Bud Richman until you save the incident. 

**-** You are not limited to a single query condition. It is, for example, possible to have a related list     of all incidents opened by the same caller in the last week, or all **open** incidents opened by the     same caller. 

**-** The **current** and **parent** objects cannot be used with the **Queries from** field. Instead, the **gs**     object is available for GlideSystem calls. 

**-** The **Edit** button is not available on defined relationships, as the relationship is scripted.

###### Before you begin 

 Role required: admin 

###### About this task 

 To receive these notifications, users must define an email address in their user record or enter an email address into the watch list email field. 

##### Important: Administrators configure email notifications for watch lists. 

 An advanced configuration using watch lists involves placing two watch lists on a form, one for the general comments on a task and another for work notes or non-public comments. By configuring separate email notifications, separate users on each watch list can be notified about different information.

 If users on a watch list are getting more than one email for each update to an incident, it can be because other recipients are replying all to an email notification. Recipients may be receiving email through their email system (Outlook, Groupwise, and so on) and through the base system. To stop this duplication, remove the names of other users from the email or the watch list. 

###### Procedure 

**1.** Open the notification to configure. 

**2.** In the Who will receive section, select the icon beside **Users/groups in fields**. 

**3.** Double-click **Watch list** in the **Available** column to move it to the **Selected** column.

 Document Viewer plugins 

 With Document Viewer, you can view documents directly in the ServiceNow Platform rather than having to download them. Two new plugins enhance the experience and provide more options for document viewing. You can collaborate with other people, copy, delete, restore, and view version history directly in a ServiceNow instance. 

##### Overview 

 In previous ServiceNow releases, not all documents could be shared and used for team collaboration. With new plugins for the Platform Document Viewer, now you can: 

**-** Collaborate (edit, share) with Microsoft OneDrive and copy documents to your ServiceNow     instance. 

**-** Upload a policy document authored in your ServiceNow instance as a Microsoft 365 document     in Microsoft 365 SharePoint. 

© 2025 ServiceNow, Inc. All rights reserved. ServiceNow, the ServiceNow logo, Now, and other ServiceNow marks are trademarks and/or registered trademarks of ServiceNow, Inc., in the United States and/or other countries. 434 


**-** Attach shared links to a record. Clicking the link opens the document in Microsoft 365     SharePoint. 

**-** ◦ The link can be shared with a co-worker, who can view and edit the document in real time. 

 ◦ The current version is also viewable in the ServiceNow instance. 

**-** Use collaboration tools such as Microsoft 365 for review and co-authoring documents. 

##### Plugins 

 To use this feature, install the following plugins: 

**-** Microsoft OneDrive Spoke 

**-** Microsoft OneDrive document service Spoke 

**-** Microsoft Azure AD Spoke for Integration Hub 

**-** Multi Provider Document Service Framework 

 See List of plugins (Rome) for a complete list of ServiceNow plugins. 

 After installation, you can use the base system subflows or customize them. Configure the subflows in the Document actions table. Once configured, they can be invoked as UI actions from List views or can be invoked through Script Include APIs. 

 Microsoft OneDrive integration plugin 

 Collaborate in Microsoft OneDrive and perform copy, delete, restore, and version actions on documents directly in a ServiceNow instance. This integration is bidirectional (performs in both directions): Changes are reflected in both Microsoft OneDrive and in the instance. 

 Microsoft Azure AD Spoke for IntegrationHub 

 The Microsoft Azure AD Spoke for Integration Hub provides actions that a Process Analyst can use when designing flows. The actions allow them to automate the management of users, security groups, and office groups. User management includes applying licenses that result in user provisioning into Office 365. 

 Multi Provider Document Service Framework plugin (glide plugin) 

 Plugin contains the data model needed to integrate with third-party document service providers.

 Tree picker examples 

 The sections below include tree picker examples. 

##### Simple dependent fields 

 It is also possible to add the tree-picker attribute on a reference field that depends on a reference field of a different type. For example, if Assigned to depends on Assignment group , it is possible to add the tree picker attribute on Assigned to. The result is a one-node tree for the group and its members. 

 Tree picker on a reference field 

##### Dependent fields 

 In this example, there are two CI reference fields, and one depends on the other. The dependent 

###### one has the tree_picker attribute:

 Tree picker on a dependent field 

 For this example, the configuration item is Bond Trading. The tree picker for the Dependent CI field shows all downstream and upstream relationships for that CI. The small orange square icon above a relationship indicates that the CI, lawson , already has an open task against it. Pointing to the orange square displays a pop-up window with information about the open task. 

##### Note: Dependencies for CIs are enforced only when the dictionary entry for the reference 

###### field has tree_picker=true in the Attributes field. 

 Dot-walking to data in related tables 

 Dot-walking provides access to fields on related tables from a form, list, or script. 

 If the current table contains a reference to another table, any field on the referenced table can be accessed using dot-walking. 

 Dot-walking references a field by building a chain of field names separated by dots (periods). 

###### For instance, incident.assigned_to.company references the company of the user 

 assigned to an incident. The recommended limit for chain length is three levels. 

 Dot-walking examples 

 Access fields on a related table from a form, list, or script by dot-walking. This topic includes examples of the different ways that you can dot-walk. 

© 2025 ServiceNow, Inc. All rights reserved. ServiceNow, the ServiceNow logo, Now, and other ServiceNow marks are trademarks and/or registered trademarks of ServiceNow, Inc., in the United States and/or other countries. 445 


##### List fields 

 You can dot-walk to related fields in a list, such as the field list in a filter. This example demonstrates how to filter the Incident [incident] table by the company of the caller who registered the incident. 

 When you open the list of fields that you want to filter, you see the list of available Incident table fields. The reference fields are followed by the related fields. For example, Caller is followed by Caller > User fields , which means that Caller is a reference field, and the related fields are user fields on the Caller record. If the related fields are not present in the list, you would select Show Related Fields at the bottom of the list. 

 When you select Show Related Fields , the menu reloads to display related fields. 

© 2025 ServiceNow, Inc. All rights reserved. ServiceNow, the ServiceNow logo, Now, and other ServiceNow marks are trademarks and/or registered trademarks of ServiceNow, Inc., in the United States and/or other countries. 446 


 When you select a related field, the menu reloads with the fields of the related table. 

 When you select Company under Caller → User fields , the field then becomes Caller.Company. 

 The following example shows where you are in the dot-walk. Each selected reference is stored at the top of the fields menu, and the number of dots preceding the field label indicate how many dots from the initial record the user has reached. 

© 2025 ServiceNow, Inc. All rights reserved. ServiceNow, the ServiceNow logo, Now, and other ServiceNow marks are trademarks and/or registered trademarks of ServiceNow, Inc., in the United States and/or other countries. 447 


 The example shows that the user is at Incident.Caller.Company. You can return to higher levels in the hierarchy by selecting fields located at the top of the menu. For instance, selecting Incident fields returns to the list of incident fields. 

 The related fields can be removed by selecting Remove Related Fields at the bottom of the list. 

© 2025 ServiceNow, Inc. All rights reserved. ServiceNow, the ServiceNow logo, Now, and other ServiceNow marks are trademarks and/or registered trademarks of ServiceNow, Inc., in the United States and/or other countries. 448 


##### Condition builders 

 You can make a detailed query on a table by dot-walking in the condition builder. 

 To dot-walk in a condition builder, first select Show Related Fields on the fields menu. This action allows you to add fields from related tables to your query. 

 The following GIF shows how you would dot-walk fields in a condition builder to find all Incident records assigned to one specific user, Beth Anglin. In the example, the user navigates to Incident > Open and then opens the condition builder. In the fields menu, the user first selects Show Related Fields and then opens the fields menu again to select Assigned to → User fields. The user opens the fields menu again to select Last name. The user builds the following condition: [Last name] [is] [Anglin]. After the user selects Run , the Incident list displays only the records assigned to Beth Anglin.

##### List collectors 

##### Note: Adding new fields via dot-walking by filling out the Create new field 

 section ("A" in example) in the Name field ("B" in example) is not supported. Adding unauthorized fields and adding fields against recommendations via dot-walking may result in unexpected behaviors in the platform. 

 When selecting a list of fields from a list collector (for example, when you are configuring a form), you can dot-walk to fields from other forms. 

 To see which fields are reference fields and can be dot-walked, look for green fields with a plus symbol. 

 Once a reference field is highlighted, the expand icon ( ) appears above the add icon. 

© 2025 ServiceNow, Inc. All rights reserved. ServiceNow, the ServiceNow logo, Now, and other ServiceNow marks are trademarks and/or registered trademarks of ServiceNow, Inc., in the United States and/or other countries. 450 


 Selecting the expand icon opens the list of fields from the related list in the Available pane. The following example shows that the Assigned to fields were selected. The previous lists of fields appear at the top of the list. 

 Once the field is added to the Selected pane, it appears with its full dot-walked syntax. The following example, shows that Assigned to.Active has been selected. 

© 2025 ServiceNow, Inc. All rights reserved. ServiceNow, the ServiceNow logo, Now, and other ServiceNow marks are trademarks and/or registered trademarks of ServiceNow, Inc., in the United States and/or other countries. 451 


##### Scripts 

 You can dot-walk within a script by invoking the dot-walk syntax. This functionality requires a knowledge of JavaScript. 

 For scripts that run on the server side, such as business rules, it is necessary to add current. 

 The following script, for example, is a scripted approval rule that requests an approval from the manager of the user who opened the ticket. 

 try{ current.opened_by.manager; } catch(err){} 

 For scripts that run on the client side, such as client scripts, current is not necessary. For instance, the following Highlight VIP Caller script runs on the client side. 

 function onChange(control, oldValue, newValue, isLoading){ //wait until there is a valid record in the field if(newValue){ //get the caller object so we can access fields var caller = g_form. getReference('caller_id'); var callerLabel = document.getElementById('label.incident.caller_id'); var callerField = document.getElementById('sys_display.incident.caller_id'); 

 //check for VIP status if(caller.vip == 'true') { //change the caller label to red background //style object is CSSStyleDeclaration, style names are not standard css names if(callerLabel) 

© 2025 ServiceNow, Inc. All rights reserved. ServiceNow, the ServiceNow logo, Now, and other ServiceNow marks are trademarks and/or registered trademarks of ServiceNow, Inc., in the United States and/or other countries. 452 


 document.getElementById('label.incident.caller_id').style.backg roundColor = 'red'; 

 //change the caller's name field to red text if(callerField) 

 document.getElementById('sys_display.incident.caller_id').style .color = 'red'; } else { //not a VIP, remove temporary styles if(callerLabel) 

 document.getElementById('label.incident.caller_id').style.backg roundColor = ''; 

 if(callerField) 

 document.getElementById('sys_display.incident.caller_id').style .color = ''; } } } 

##### Variables 

 Often, you can add variables into templates, notifications, or other forms where a value is being called from the form. 

###### For example, ${assigned_to} is the variable for the Assigned to field. 

 As shown in the example, you can dot-walk to fields on the original record of any reference field. It is possible to dot-walk to any field on the assigned_to record, for example, 

###### ${assigned_to.manager}. 

 When you dot-walk, you can have a longer chain if you need it, as in this example: 

###### ${assigned_to.department.manager.mobile_phone}. 

 Sometimes, you can select this variable from a tree picker. 

##### Tree pickers 

 The tree picker interface has an expandable, hierarchical view that you can use to look up the following items: 

**-** Configuration Items (CIs) that are subordinate to another, higher-level CI. 

**-** Members of a certain group. For example, you would use a tree picker to look up a user in the     Service Desk group. 

**-** Reference elements for any hierarchical table. A hierarchical table is any table that has a     parent field pointing back at itself. The Group [sys_user_group] table, for example, would be     considered a hierarchical table because certain groups are children of parent groups. 

 The following example shows how you would use a tree picker to assign an Incident record to a user in the Database group. 

 You would first navigate to any Incident record and then enter Database in the Assignment group field. 

© 2025 ServiceNow, Inc. All rights reserved. ServiceNow, the ServiceNow logo, Now, and other ServiceNow marks are trademarks and/or registered trademarks of ServiceNow, Inc., in the United States and/or other countries. 453 


 In this example, the Database group is a parent group with multiple child groups under it. When 

 you select the search icon ( ) next to the Assigned to field, a window displays reference fields in the Database group. 

 Reference fields have the expand icon (+) next to their name. Clicking the + expands a list of the fields on that referenced field. In this example, expanding the Database Atlanta or Database San Diego fields opens a list of user records within each child group. 

 You would select any one of the user records to add it as a value in the Assigned to field. 

##### Note: You can configure the tree picker to pick up to 1,000 nodes when you configure the 

###### glide.ui.group_heirarchy.max_nodes property. To set the property, open the 

 Dictionary attributes for the field, and add tree_picker=true to the Attributes field. If there are multiple attributes, use a comma to separate them without any spaces between. 

 Configure items on forms or in lists using a list collector 

 Use a list collector to add, remove, or move items in a form or list. List collectors allow you to select multiple items from a list of available items and to remove items from a list of selected

 items. Some list collectors provide filter and search controls for available items, such as adding items to related lists. 

###### Before you begin 

 Role required: admin 

###### About this task 

 Use list collectors to personalize lists, add items to related lists, and Service Catalog list collector variables. Some list collectors allow users to customize the order of selections, such as when you are configuring a form or list. 

 The list collector interface has two columns: the available items on the left and the selected items on the right. 

 Information fields for the highlighted available item appear beneath some list collectors. The information fields are the same as the reference lookup for a reference field on a form. To modify which fields appear, configure the reference lookup list. 

###### Procedure 

**-** To add items to the selection, double-click an available item on the left or select an item and     click the add icon ( **>** ).     The new item is added at the bottom of the selected items column on the right. 

**-** To remove items from the selection, double-click the item on the right, or select the item and     click the remove icon ( **<** ). 

**-** To select multiple consecutive items, hold the Shift key and click the first and last item. 

**-** To select multiple non-consecutive items, hold the Ctrl key (Command key on Mac) and click     the desired items. 

**-** To accessibly select multiple items, tab to each item and press the spacebar to select each     item.     Use the arrow key or tab to the **Add** button to move items from one list to another. 

**-** To filter available items, create conditions using the condition builder and click **Run filter**. 

**-** To search available items, enter text in the **Search** field. 

 The list of available items is filtered as you type.

 Activity streams 

 An activity stream is a list of entries in records and conversations, such as journal fields, comments, and work notes that display in task records and Sidebar conversations. Activity streams are available Core UI. 

 The three types of activity streams are as follows: 

 List activity stream 

 Streams live activity information for all records on the current list. For more information, see Activity streams in list view. You can click an item to open the record activity stream without opening the record. 

 Record activity stream 

 Appears in forms that are configured with the activity formatter. You can customize the activities to include in this type of stream. 

 When you follow a record to view it in the Connect Chat interface, the conversation contains the same information as the record activity stream. Comments that are entered in the Connect Chat window update the record activity stream. 

 Visual Task Board 

 Streams live activity information for all task cards in the current task board. You can click an item in the activity stream to open the task card and view the activity stream of the record. 

##### Attachments and images 

 You can add and preview attachments and images in the activity stream by doing the following actions: 

**-** Paste an image into a journal field and enter the inline text. 

**-** Click an attachment to preview it. Use the download option to download the attachment locally. 

**-** Use antivirus scanning to protect against virus infections that can be introduced by file     attachments. After being uploaded, the system automatically scans all files for viruses. If a file     is infected, you can't view or download the file. 

##### @ Mentions 

 Get someone's attention on a record by mentioning them with the @ character in an activity stream. 

##### Note: Emails sent for @Mention run against the live_notification table and are not added 

 to the journal field of the parent table. 

 Any user can use activity stream mentions in the following places: 

© 2025 ServiceNow, Inc. All rights reserved. ServiceNow, the ServiceNow logo, Now, and other ServiceNow marks are trademarks and/or registered trademarks of ServiceNow, Inc., in the United States and/or other countries. 458 


**-** On a form, in the activity formatter (Core UI only). 

**-** In a list, in the activity stream for a record. 

**-** On a Visual Task Board card, in the card details. 

**-** In a Connect record conversation. 

 To mention someone, enter the @ character in a supported activity stream. Next, select a user from the suggestion list to select any user in the instance. You can see which users have access to the record and, if presence is enabled, who is online. Enter any other text and post to the activity stream. The following example shows an Mention on a form. 

 Activity stream mention on a form 

 By default, you receive an email notification when someone mentions you. You can disable this behavior by unsubscribing from the Activity Stream @Mention Email notification on your notification preferences. 

 If Connect is enabled, you can receive additional notifications, depending on whether you follow the record in Connect. When someone mentions you in a record that you do not follow in Connect, you receive whichever Connect notifications you enabled globally, as well as the Activity Stream @Mention Email notification. If you do follow the record in Connect, you only receive notifications according to your notification preferences for the record conversation. In this case, you do not receive the Activity Stream @Mention Email notification.

##### Note: The system creates a record on the notification [live_notification] table each time a 

 user is mentioned. The record stores the information required to generate notifications. 

 You can filter out emails in the activity stream, for example, auto-generated and correspondence 

 emails, by selecting the. Select Post types to check or clear the boxes of the types of emails and posts that display in your activity stream. 

##### Note: The activity stream displays either a user's first and last name or their user name/ 

###### user id, depending on the system property glide.ui.activity.displayname. It is 

 possible that old entries in the activity stream will display a different user name/user id for the same user, if the value has changed. For more information, see KB1706641. 

 Create a condition statement using the condition builder 

 A condition builder constructs a condition statement with a series of contextually generated fields. Condition builders are used in many operations, such as creating filters, administering surveys, and administering access control. 

###### Before you begin 

 Role required: admin 

###### About this task 

 A condition consists of three parts. 

 Part Description 

 Field A choice list based on the table and user access rights. The choice list can include fields on related tables by dot-walking. 

 Operator A choice list based on the field type. For example, in the Incident [incident] table, the greater than operator does not apply to the Active field but it does apply to the Priority field. 

 Value A text entry field or a choice list, depending on field type. For example, in the Incident [incident] table, the Active field offers a choice list with the values true , false , and empty , while the Short Description field offers a text entry field. 

###### Procedure 

**1.** To add a dependent condition, select **AND** or **OR** next to the condition. 

**2.** To add a top-level condition, select **AND** or **OR** on the condition builder toolbar above the     conditions.

 Condition builder 

 A condition builder constructs a condition statement with a series of contextually generated fields. Condition builders are used in many operations, such as creating filters, administering surveys, and administering access control. 

##### Condition builder format 

 A condition consists of three parts: 

**-** Field: a choice list based on the table and user access rights. The choice list can include fields     on related tables by dot-walking. 

**-** Operator: a choice list based on the field type. For example, in the Incident [incident] table, the     greater than operator does not apply to the **Active** field but it does apply to the **Priority** field. 

**-** Value: a text entry field or a choice list, depending on field type. For example, in the Incident     [incident] table, the **Active** field offers a choice list with the values **true** , **false** , and **empty** ,     while the **Short Description** field offers a text entry field. 

 The conditions display above lists in Core UI as a breadcrumb, summarizing what you have selected. 

##### Note: The condition builder breadcrumb in Core UI list view can be truncated depending 

 on the values of two system properties: 

**-** glide.ui.breadcrumb_max_entries: specifies the maximum number of items     displayed in the breadcrumb, with a default of 10. 

**-** glide.ui.export.choice_list_max_characters: specifies the maximum     number of characters displayed for a choice list within the breadcrumb, with a default of     80.

 Filtering on empty fields 

 Most filter operations do not return empty fields in their result set. You can create a filter that displays records with an empty field value in addition to records that match the initial filter conditions. 

###### About this task 

 For example, when viewing all records that are assigned to the Hardware group, to include records with an empty Assignment group field, complete the following steps. 

###### Procedure 

**1.** Create the filter condition **[Assignment group] [is] [Hardware]**. 

##### Note: This condition does not return those records where the Assignment group field is 

 empty. 

**2.** Click **OR** next to the original filter condition. 

**3.** Create another filter condition of **[Assignment group] [is empty]**. 

**4.** Run the filter. 

 Values for date/time fields 

 When you filter on fields of type date/time, such as the Created field on any task record, several time-related options are available, such as Today , This week , Last 3 months , and so on. 

 For example, at 12:00 on June 1, a user in New York filters a list of incidents using the Created on Today condition. The resulting list shows all incidents created during the last twelve hours: between midnight (00:00:00) and the user's current time, noon (12:00:00), on June 1. A filter for This week returns incidents created between the previous Monday at midnight to the current day and time. 

© 2025 ServiceNow, Inc. All rights reserved. ServiceNow, the ServiceNow logo, Now, and other ServiceNow marks are trademarks and/or registered trademarks of ServiceNow, Inc., in the United States and/or other countries. 462 


 A filter for Last 3 months returns incidents between midnight on the first of the month three full months ago and the current day and time. For example, if you choose the Last 3 months filter on April 15, the results show records created since January 1 up until April 15. A filter for Last 12 months returns results from January to January. 

 A filter for Last week returns incidents from midnight on Sunday the week previous ending the following Sunday at midnight. It does not include up to the present day. For example, if you choose the Last week filter on Thursday August 17, the results show records created Sunday August 6 up until Sunday August 13. 

 For the at or before and at or after filters, use midnight as a start or end point. For example, if you filter a list of incidents created [at or after] [Yesterday] , the resulting list shows all incidents created at midnight yesterday or later. If it is Thursday, August 7, and you filter a list of incidents created [at or before] [Last week] , the resulting list shows all incidents created at and before midnight on Sunday August 3, which is the end of last week.

 Comparing field values 

 Field comparison allows users to evaluate equality between fields on the same table or on related tables by using operators in the condition builder. 

 Also, you can compare date type fields to determine whether the values are within a certain range of each other. For example, you can compare the planned start date of a task to the actual start date. You can use field comparisons in a list view and to generate reports. 

 The primary function of field comparison is evaluating whether two fields on a record or related record have identical values. For example, you can create a filter to display all incidents whose Caller field references the same user record as the Closed by field. 

##### Available operators 

 Field comparison provides several filter operators for comparing field values. 

**- [is same]** if two field values are the same, evaluates to true. 

**- [is different]** if two field values are not the same, evaluates to true. 

**- [is less than]** if two date values are within a user-defined range of each other, evaluates to true. 

**- [is more than]** if two date values are not within a user-defined range of each other, evaluates to     true. 

##### Comparing choice list values 

 Field comparison compares the dictionary Value field of a choice list, not the Label value. For example, a high priority incident has a priority value of 1 , not 1 High. To find the Value of a choice, right-click the field label and select Configure Dictionary. The Choices related list shows the Value for each choice. 

##### Comparing empty fields 

 By default, most filter operations do not return empty fields in their result set. To include records with empty fields in a result set, add a filter condition for the left operand with an operator of [is empty]. For more information, see Filtering on empty fields. 

##### Using operators and operands 

 When comparing fields, the two fields being compared are called the left operand and right operand. The type of field selected in the left operand, and the operator selected, determine which right operands are available. When using the [is same] or [is different] operators, the right 

© 2025 ServiceNow, Inc. All rights reserved. ServiceNow, the ServiceNow logo, Now, and other ServiceNow marks are trademarks and/or registered trademarks of ServiceNow, Inc., in the United States and/or other countries. 465 


 operand choices include only fields of the same field type, such as String or Integer , as the left operand. 

 For example, a filter on the Task [task] table with a left operand of [Opened by] and an operator of [is same] , only allows you to choose user reference fields, such as the [Closed by] field, in the right operand. 

 The [is more than] and [is less than] operators are only available with date type fields. 

 This example filter returns records where the user who opened the record also closed the record. 

 Example filter 

##### Comparable fields 

 Field comparison supports the comparison of several fields. The fields that are comparable include the following types: 

**-** String, choice, integer, and boolean fields: Return true if both values match. 

**-** Reference fields: Return true if both reference fields refer to the same record. 

**-** Date and time fields: Can match date values based on hour, day, week, month, quarter, or year.     Also, you can evaluate whether two dates fall within a certain range of each other. 

##### Note: Field comparison does not support journal, keyword, script, duration, list, or HTML 

 fields. 

##### Comparing dates 

 Date comparison allows you to evaluate equality between two components of the date, such as the hour of the day or the date within a month. Also, you can evaluate if two dates fall within a certain range of each other. 

 Date comparisons are based on the active user's time zone. For example, as a user in the PST time zone, a filter of [Created] [is same] [Day] as [Closed] evaluates true for an incident created at 6 AM PST and closed at 3:00 PM PST as both times are within the same day. However, a user in the GMT time zone would not see this same incident record in response to the example filter; in GMT those times do not fall on the same date. 

 You can Evaluate equality between date values and you can evaluate unequal dates within a range. 

##### Evaluate unequal dates within a range 

 You can compare unequal date field values by evaluating whether two dates fall within a certain range of each other. For example, you can create a filter of [Created on] [is more than] [3] [Months] [before] Closed] to display all records that were created at least three months before they were closed. The numerical value specified, such as the value 3 in the example, must be an integer of no more than two digits. For evaluations of differences larger than 99 units, select a less granular unit of time, such as Months instead of Days.

 Unit of time Hours, Days, Weeks, Months, Quarters, Years 

 Relative position of dates before, after, before or after 

 Evaluate equality between date values 

 Date comparison evaluates a match for one of several date increments. 

###### Before you begin 

 Role required: none 

###### About this task 

 You can specify granularity to the hour, day, week, month, quarter, or year. For example, the filter [Created on] [is same] [Week] as [Closed] returns records that were closed in the same week that they were opened. When you run this type of filter, be sure to specify the year in an additional filter condition of [Created] [is same] [Year] as [Closed] to eliminate records that were created a year before they were closed. 

 Date field comparison 

###### Procedure 

**1.** In the condition builder, create a new condition. 

**2.** Select a date field from the left operand choice list. 

**3.** Select **[is same]** or **[is different]** from the operator choice list.     An additional choice list appears. 

**4.** Select the granularity from the date range choice list.

 Date Range 

 Description 

 Day Filters on the day of the month, not the date. For example, a Day value of the 1 of August matches with a Day value of the 1 of September. 

 Week Filters on the week of the year. ServiceNow defines a week as Sunday through Saturday for the purposes of Field Comparison. 

 Month Filters on the month of the year. For example, any date within December returns the 12 month of the year. 

 Quarter Filters on the quarter of the year. 

 Year Filters on the year. 

**5.** Select a different date field from the right operand choice list. 

**6.** Click **Run**. 

 Operators available for filters and queries

© 2025 ServiceNow, Inc. All rights reserved. ServiceNow, the ServiceNow logo, Now, and other ServiceNow marks are trademarks and/or registered trademarks of ServiceNow, Inc., in the United States and/or other countries. 490 


###### About this task 

 By default, the Zing text indexing and search engine does not index tag text for search. You can enable text indexing of tags on a table-by-table basis. Private tags are never indexed. 

 When you enable text indexing for a table's tags, Zing stores search data for the tags in its text index for that table. This increases the text index's size. The exact increase depends on the number of indexable tags present in records on the table. 

###### Procedure 

**1.** Navigate to **All** > **System Definition** > **Dictionary** and edit the dictionary entry for the table you     want to enable tag indexing for.     The dictionary entry for a table is the record with the table's name as its **Table** field value, an     empty **Column name** field, and a **Type** value of Collection. 

**2.** In the Attributes related list, select **New**. 

**3.** Select the Lookup using list icon ( ) to see all available attributes. 

###### 4. Select the Text Index Tags attribute ( text_index_tags). 

**5.** For the attribute value, enter one of the following options. 

 Option Description 

 everyone_only Only tags shared with everyone are indexed. 

 all_shared All shared tags ( Everyone , Groups and Users ) are indexed. 

**6.** Select **Submit**. 

**7.** In the Dictionary Entry form's Related Links section, select **Generate Text Index** to reindex the     table. 

###### What to do next 

 After you turn on text indexing for tags on a table, records on the table are reindexed when any of the following actions occurs. 

**-** When you add or remove tags. 

**-** When you modify a tag, as long as fewer than 100 records are affected. If there are more     records, you must manually reindex. 

**-** When you manually reindex an entire table (required after initial tag indexing setup). 

 Assigning tags 

 You can assign tags to records from the form or list view. You can also add tags to a homepage. Tags enable you to group and organize the items. 

 The list view provides multiple ways of assigning tags. You can assign tags with inline field editing, the action menu, the context menu, or the edit tags icon. 

##### Note: Tag names are case-insensitive and must not include punctuation. 

 Assign a tag from the list view using inline field editing

 Navigation stack 

 The navigation stack is the portion of the ServiceNow suite of applications that determines where a user is redirected after the update of a record. 

 An administrator can cause page references to be manually inserted into the navigation stack when a link in the Navigation Page is clicked. This is done by modifying a module definition 

###### to include an argument of sysparm_stack with a string value equal to the URL reference 

 to the page to be inserted into the stack. The administrator can also override the redirection determined by the stack by creating a business rule or editing an existing one to include gs.setRedirect("http://redirect_page.com"). 

##### Operating parameters of the navigation stack 

 The navigation stack can be thought of a user's navigation history in the instance. It is updated every time a user views a new page. The navigation stack is referenced when users press the page back button. It is also referenced when a user submits or updates a record, at which point users are redirected to their last page in the navigation stack. 

 Back and Submit or Update 

##### Inserting pages to the navigation stack 

 The administrator can insert page references manually into the navigation stack when a link in the navigation page is clicked. The module definition is modified to include an argument of 

###### sysparm_stack with a string value equal to the URL reference to the page to insert into the 

 stack. The following image shows the system definition for the Incident > Create New module. By 

###### passing an argument of "sysparm_stack=incident_list.do", the list view of incidents 

 (incident_list.do) is added to the stack. After submitting an incident, the user is directed to this page.

##### Overriding the redirection behaviors of the navigation stack with onEvent 

##### business rules 

 The redirection behaviors that occur as a result of navigation stack behaviors can be overridden using onEvent business rules. This override is performed by using the function 

###### gs.setRedirect. Doing so overrides the redirection as determined by the navigation stack, 

###### when the specified event occurs. The function gs.setRedirect takes a string argument 

 that is a URL for the page that the user is redirected to. This URL can be external, for example: 

###### gs.setRedirect('http://www.google.com'). 

 Navigation action cancellation 

 The Request Manager allows users to cancel any navigation action they select from the application navigator by clicking another application navigator link. System properties work with settings for the table to allow navigation action cancellation. 

 This allows users to cancel slow loading transactions without having to wait for the previous transaction to complete. 

 One of the following conditions must be true for the Request Manager to cancel a transaction. 

**-** Both the original transaction and new transaction are cancelable (both transactions have the 

###### setting sysparm_cancelable=true). 

**-** The original transaction is a member of the always cancelable allow list (the module is listed 

###### in the glide.request_manager.always_cancel system property) and the new 

###### transaction is cancelable (has the setting sysparm_cancelable=true). 

**-** Both the original and new transaction produce an auto-completer query in a reference field. 

##### Cancellation workflow 

 The Request Manager uses the following workflow to determine whether to cancel a transaction.

 Cancel navigation actions 

 Navigation cancellation system properties 

 Property Description 

###### glide.request_manager.cancel_other_transaction Enables or disables 

 automatic cancellation behaviors. When true, users can cancel one navigation action with another navigation action. 

 Type: true | false 

 Default value: true 

 Location: sys_properties table

 Navigation cancellation system properties (continued) 

 Property Description 

###### glide.request_manager.always_cancel A comma-separated list 

 of URIs that users can always cancel by clicking another navigation action. Typically items on this list are modules that provide read-only data such as dashboards, reports, or knowledge articles. 

 Type: string 

 Default value: home,sys_report_template 

 Location: sys_properties table 

###### glide.request_manager.cancel_reference_completer Cancels a user query in 

 a reference field when the user enters more information. For example, if the user starts an AJAX search in the Problem number field by entering PRB and then enters PRB000 , the second query cancels the first query. 

 Type: true | false 

 Default value: true 

 Location: sys_properties table 

##### Use cases 

 There are three use cases where administrators can control user cancellation actions. 

**1.** A user clicks a module, such as the homepage (home.do), and while     waiting for the module to load decides to navigate to another module, such     as the list of open incidents (incident_list.do). The system property 

###### glide.request_manager.cancel_other_transaction controls this use case. 

**2.** A user clicks a module that displays read-only data, such as a report     (sys_report_template.do?sysparm=sysid), and while waiting     for the module to load decides to navigate to another module, such as     the list of open incidents (incident_list.do). The system properties 

###### glide.request_manager.cancel_other_transaction and 

###### glide.request_manager.always_cancel control this use case. 

© 2025 ServiceNow, Inc. All rights reserved. ServiceNow, the ServiceNow logo, Now, and other ServiceNow marks are trademarks and/or registered trademarks of ServiceNow, Inc., in the United States and/or other countries. 508 


**3.** A user starts typing a query in a reference field, such as entering PRB in the     related Problem field and while waiting for the auto-completer to display results,     decides to enter more information, such as PRB000. The system properties 

###### glide.request_manager.cancel_other_transaction and 

###### glide.request_manager.cancel_reference_completer control this use case. 

 Add sites to the always cancel list 

 You can add UI pages or other links to the always cancel list so that users can cancel actions on these pages by navigating to another module or link.

 Prevent users from canceling module transactions 

 You can explicitly prevent users from canceling the activity of a module by updating the module definition. 

###### Before you begin 

 Role required: admin 

###### Procedure 

**1.** Point to the application menu you want to add the module to and click the edit application     (pencil) icon. 

**2.** In the **Modules** related list, click the module you want to prevent users from canceling. 

**3.** Configuring the form layout layout and add the field **Uncancelable by Other Modules**. 

**4.** Select the check box for **Uncancelable by Other Modules**. 

**5.** Click **Update**. 

 Context-sensitive help 

 By default, the help link available in the product opens the welcome page of the help system, allowing you to enter search criteria for the information you want to find. With context-sensitive help, you can set a base URL for an external help system. The context-sensitive system properties define the base URLs for the default and custom help systems. 

 The ServiceNow system provides several preconfigured help contexts connected to this link that display the exact information you need for the current list, form, or record. You can define your own help topics and configure them to appear when you click the help icon in a ServiceNow record. 

 Users click the help icon to open the default help pages provided in the base system. For any page that does not have context-sensitive help defined, the instance displays the help system welcome page. Users can use the search feature or the index to find the correct help topic. The location of the help icon depends on the user interface version you are using. 

##### Core UI 

 Click the help icon in the right corner of the header bar and select Search Product Documentation from the menu.

 Context help access in Core UI 

 Alternatively, administrators can create custom context-sensitive help to suit the needs of their organizations. Create a help context that links the help icon to a topic describing a list, form, or specific record. You may initially want to set a base URL to direct to a help system other than the default ServiceNow help system. 

##### Set base URLs 

 To create numerous help contexts that direct to a single server other than the ServiceNow help 

###### system, enter the base URL in the help.base.default property. 

 Base URL for custom help contexts 

© 2025 ServiceNow, Inc. All rights reserved. ServiceNow, the ServiceNow logo, Now, and other ServiceNow marks are trademarks and/or registered trademarks of ServiceNow, Inc., in the United States and/or other countries. 511 


 On the Help Context form, when the ServiceNow Product Documentation check box is cleared and you enter a value in the URL or page name field that does not contain the string ://, that 

###### value is appended to the base URL defined by help.base.default property. 

##### Note: When the ServiceNow Product Documentation check box is cleared and the URL 

 or page name field contains an absolute URL (distinguished by the string :// in the value), 

###### the value in the help.base.default property is ignored. This allows you to create help 

 contexts that link to several different servers. 

##### Context-sensitive help properties 

 To access the context-sensitive help properties, navigate to sys_properties.list and filter by Name. You can edit a property value from the list or by opening the property record. 

 Property Name Description Default Value 

 glide.help.default.page The default URL the help icon directs to when no help context is specified. This is the base URL of the ServiceNow help system and opens to the welcome page. Do not change this value. 

 http:// servicenow.com/ docs/ 

 help.base.default The base URL for custom help contexts in which the ServiceNow Product Documentation check box is cleared, and an absolute URL is not specified. 

 When the base URL is set, the system creates the address of a help conext record by appending the target page or file name to the base URL. Custom help contexts using this base URL overwrite the help provided by default in your instance for the same table. For details, see set base URLs. 

 http:// servicenow.com/ docs/?context= 

 help.base.servicenow The base URL for help contexts in which the ServiceNow Wiki check box is selected. 

 This is the base URL for the help provided in your instance by default. Do not change this value. For details, see Create a new help context. 

 http:// servicenow.com/ docs/?context= 

 Create a new help context 

 You can create new help contexts to supplement or replace the default help contexts. For example, if your organization has heavily customized a form, you might create a new help context for that form. The customized help context could link to more relevant information, such as a company knowledge base article. 

###### Before you begin 

 Role required: none 

###### Procedure 

**1.** Navigate to **All** > **System UI** > **Help Contexts**. 

**2.** Click **New**. 

**3.** Complete the Help Context form from the fields in the table.

 Help context form 

 Field Description 

 Type Select Form , List , or Record. 

 If you select Record , the Table name field is replaced by the Document field. 

 Table name Select the table for which the help context is being defined. 

 If the Type is Record , this field is replaced by the Document field. 

##### Note: The list shows only tables and database views that are in the 

 same scope as the help context. 

 Document 

 Click the reference lookup icon ( ) to open the document selection dialog box (pictured). Select the table and document (record) for this help context. 

 This field is only visible if you have selected Record as the Type. 

 Language Select the language of the help page to which you are linking. The choices available depend on which I18n Translation plugins you have activated. For more information, see Activate a language. 

 This field allows you to create multiple help contexts for the same form, list, or record, each directing to a help page in a different language. For example, you might have two help contexts for Form X: one for English and the other for Spanish. If a user whose language is set to Spanish clicks the help icon while viewing Form X, the help page defined in the Spanish help context opens. 

 Active Select this check box to have the system use the help context. This check box is selected by default for new help contexts. 

 ServiceNow Product Documentation 

 Indicates if this help was created by a customer or was provided by ServiceNow. Clear this check box to create custom help for your organization. 

 Do not attempt to modify existing help topics provided by ServiceNow for your own use. The system is configured to use your custom records rather than the default help contexts, even when they are created on the same table. 

 URL or page name 

 Identifies the topic to display when a user clicks the help icon while viewing a form, list, or record. 

© 2025 ServiceNow, Inc. All rights reserved. ServiceNow, the ServiceNow logo, Now, and other ServiceNow marks are trademarks and/or registered trademarks of ServiceNow, Inc., in the United States and/or other countries. 513 


 Field Description 

 You can enter the complete URL of the help page or just the target file name 

###### if you set a base URL in the help.base.default system property. 

##### Note: If you reconfigure the fields on the form, you see the available fields Plugin ID and 

 System Property Base URL. Do not use these fields. They are for internal use only. 

**4.** Click **Submit**.

 Help context types and prioritization 

 You can create a help context with the type Form , List , or Record , and link it to a particular table in your ServiceNow instance. If you have multiple help contexts, prioritization determines which help contexts apply to what a user views. 

##### Help context types 

 When a user clicks the help icon, the system analyzes the relevant help contexts to determine which help page to display. 

**-** Record-level help applies to only one specific record, not the list or form for that table. 

 For example, if a Record type help context exists for the Validate Number record in the Business Rule table, the help icon only directs to the page specified when a user views that record. 

**-** List-level help applies to the list for a table. If no form-level help is defined, list-level help also     applies to the form for the same table. 

 For example, if a List type but not a Form type help context exists for the Business Rule table, the help icon directs to the page specified by the List type help context when a user views any list or record (if record-level help is not defined for it) in the Business Rule table. 

**-** Form-level help applies to the form for a table. If no list-level help is defined, the form-level help     also applies to the list for the same table. 

 For example, if a Form type but not a List type help context exists for the Business Rule table, the help icon directs to the page specified by the Form type help context when you view any record (if record-level help is not defined for it) or list in the Business Rule table. 

**-** If both list- and form-level help are defined for a table, the appropriate help is displayed for the     list and the form. 

 For example, if a List type and a Form type help context exist for the Business Rule table, the help icon directs to the page specified by the List type help context when a user views the Business Rules list. The help icon directs to the page specified by the Form type help context when a user views any record (if record-level help is not defined for it) in the Business Rule table. 

##### Important: If you create a help context for a base table list or record, the help system 

 opens that target topic for any list or record in a table that extends the base table if no other help context is created in that extended table. 

© 2025 ServiceNow, Inc. All rights reserved. ServiceNow, the ServiceNow logo, Now, and other ServiceNow marks are trademarks and/or registered trademarks of ServiceNow, Inc., in the United States and/or other countries. 514 


##### Help context prioritization 

 When there are several matching help context records, the following rules determine which help context is used, in descending order of priority. 

**1.** A customer-created help context is used instead of a default help context provided in the     instance for the same table. 

**2.** A help context that matches the user's language setting is used instead of a help context in the     default language of the instance. See the **Language** field on the Help Context form. 

**3.** A help context for a closer table in an extended table hierarchy is used instead of a help     context for a further table. 

 Consider the case of the Linux Server [cmdb_ci_linux_server] table, which has the following parentage: cmdbi_ci > cmdb_ci_hardware > cmdb_ci_computer > cmdb_ci_server > cmdb_ci_linux_server. If help contexts exist for both the cmdb_ci_server table and the cmdb_ci table, the help icon directs to the page specified by the cmdb_ci_server help context when you view a record in the cmdb_ci_linux_server table. 

 Overview help pages

 System user guide 

 The system user guide enables you to create end user help documentation that is specific to the policies and procedures of your organization. A default help page is provided in the base system that displays Core UI help documents for system navigation and other basic operations. 

 The user guide provides the tools for designing help portal pages containing feature-specific help documents. You can create custom help pages and deploy them in various ways using controls in the system. User guide documents are grouped in relevant sections on a help page, using a two-column format. You can display the sections and the documents within them in any order. You can display a section on more than one help page. The user guide is supported in Core UI. 

 A default help page is provided in the base system that displays help documents for system navigation and other basic operations. This page is accessible from the help icon in the header bar for Core UI users. To make this page available to users of other supported UI versions, you must create a programmatic entry point. 

##### Note: The default help page can be used as a template for your own help content. To 

 personalize pages, sections, or documents in the User Guide, simply edit the ServiceNow 

 ® 

 records to suit your needs. Remember that any records you customize are not updated when you upgrade your instance to a new version. Review any changes on a development system first and then decide whether to accept the updated content into your customized User Guide.

 Storing images in the database 

 Administrators and users with the image_admin or content_admin role can upload and store images in the database. These images are saved in the Images [db_image] table. Uploading an image to the database allows it to be referenced from HTML fields by appending the name of the image to the URL of the instance. 

##### Note: The db_image table is a public table that does not have any security restrictions. 

 Unauthenticated users have full access to images uploaded to the db_image table. 

##### Images vs attachments 

 If you want to access an image from a record, or if you want to prevent users from appending the image name to the URL of the instance, upload it as an attachment instead. When you upload an image as an attachment, the image is saved in the Attachments [sys_attachment] table. See Administer attachments and Add and manage attachments for more information. 

##### Acceptable image file types 

 Upload image files with the following extensions: 

**-** .gif 

**-** .jpg 

**-** .png 

**-** .bmp 

##### Note: The system does not support uploading zip files that contain .bmp images. 

 If you upload an image that may not be supported in Internet Explorer browsers, a warning message appears. 

 The system does not support uploading images in the .ico format through this interface. Microsoft Internet Explorer requires the .ico format for favorite icons. To upload an .ico image, attach the .ico image to a record instead of using the standard image upload interface. 

 To understand how to insert an image into a form record, see the Insert an image into your article, incident, or other form record blog post in the ServiceNow Community. 

 Update an existing image 

 You can change an existing image to an updated version. 

###### Before you begin 

 Role required: image_admin or content_admin 

###### Procedure 

**1.** Navigate to **All** > **System UI** > **Images**. 

**2.** In the Images list, click the name of the image to be replaced. 

**3.** In the **Image** field, click the **[Update]** link. 

**4.** Click **Browse** and navigate to the desired image file. 

**5.** Click **Open** , and then click **OK**. 

© 2025 ServiceNow, Inc. All rights reserved. ServiceNow, the ServiceNow logo, Now, and other ServiceNow marks are trademarks and/or registered trademarks of ServiceNow, Inc., in the United States and/or other countries. 530 


 The new file is uploaded into the instance database, replacing the previous file. It is used in all locations that reference the file name. 

##### Note: If the new image does not appear as expected, clear the browser cache. 

 Upload one or more images 

 You can upload one image or multiple images at one time. 

###### Before you begin 

 Role required: image_admin or content_admin 

###### Procedure 

**1.** To upload one image at a time, complete the following steps: 

 a. Navigate to System UI > Images to see the list of images stored in the database. 

 b. Click New to add a new image. 

 c. Complete the form. 

 Images form 

 Field Input 

 Name Enter the file name by which to reference the image in HTML.

 c. Click Choose File then select the file. 

 d. Click Upload. 

 A message indicates that the files are uploaded to the database, and the images list is sorted by updated date in descending order (the uploaded images appear first). 

##### Note: 

 ◦ If the .zip file contains a folder structure, the resulting image names are the path name with underscores in place of the slashes. For example, if the .zip contains myimages/ image1.gif then the resulting image is named myimages_image1.gif. 

 ◦ Image names cannot exceed 100 characters in length, including folder structure. Files with excessively long names are rejected. 

 ◦ Uploads are logged in the system. View system logs to see whether files are uploaded or rejected.

###### Before you begin 

 Role required: admin 

###### Procedure 

**1.** Enter sys_properties.list in the Navigation filter. 

**2.** Verify that the property does not exist by searching for the property name. 

© 2025 ServiceNow, Inc. All rights reserved. ServiceNow, the ServiceNow logo, Now, and other ServiceNow marks are trademarks and/or registered trademarks of ServiceNow, Inc., in the United States and/or other countries. 532 


**3.** Click **New**. 

**4.** Complete the system property using the following table. 

 File extension system properties 

 Field Description 

 Name glide.ui.strict_content_types 

 Type string 

 Value Comma-separated list of acceptable image file names. Use any of the following file types: ico,gif,png,jpg,jpeg,bmp,js,css,htm,html,ogg,mp3,eot,woff,woff2 

##### Note: Any files that use a file extension that is not included in the list of values appear 

 broken in the UI. 

 User preferences 

 Users can configure many UI features, such as the number of rows per page in a list or whether the response time displays at the bottom of a list or form. Administrators can modify or delete these preferences as needed. 

 User customizations are stored as records in the User preferences [sys_user_preference] table, and are updated each time the user changes the setting. The UI displays according to each user's preferences. 

 For example, the response time may appear at the bottom of lists and forms by default. If a user hides the response time, a user preference record is created for them showing that the response time indicator as hidden. During the user's future sessions, the response time indicator is hidden. If the user later decides to display the response time, the user preference record is updated appropriately, and future sessions open with the response time indicator visible. 

 For more information about the preferences available to users, see User preference settings and Next Experience preferences. 

##### Viewing and troubleshooting user preferences 

 Navigate to User Administration > User Preferences for a list of user preference records. Select a preference name to display that preference in the form view. If troubleshooting for a user, search for their user name to find all of their customizations, and then select a preference name to view. 

##### Note: A maximum of 10,000 user preferences can be there for each user, exceeding this 

 limit causes system degradation and UI performance issues. 

 User preference fields 

 Field Description 

 Name The name of the feature or functionality. 

 Description An optional short description of the feature or functionality. 

 System Shows whether this record indicates the system-wide default ( TRUE ), or not ( FALSE ). 

© 2025 ServiceNow, Inc. All rights reserved. ServiceNow, the ServiceNow logo, Now, and other ServiceNow marks are trademarks and/or registered trademarks of ServiceNow, Inc., in the United States and/or other countries. 533 


 User preference fields (continued) 

 Field Description 

 Type Shows the data type of entry accepted for the Value. For example, you can select string or integer. 

 User Shows the name of the user for whom the setting is customized. If User is empty, the record is for a system-wide default. 

 Value The current setting for this record. Compare this value to the User field and System field to determine whether the value shown is a system-wide default or a specific user’s preference. 

 You can identify user preference records for system-wide values, also called the default or global values, by the following values: 

**- System=TRUE** 

**- User=blank** 

 Whenever a user customizes a feature, a separate user preference record is created with the following values: 

**- System=FALSE** 

**- User=<username>** 

 As a result, the same customizable UI feature may have multiple user preference records. 

##### Note: For some features, the system-wide record doesn’t appear in the User preferences 

 module until a user customizes it, causing a new record to be added to the User preferences. 

 If a user encounters an unexplained behavior in the user interface, you can check their user preferences by searching the User preferences list for their user name. Then, delete or update the user preference record that affects the behavior in question. 

##### Note: When an administrator manually changes a user's preference value through this 

 module, the user's next session uses the administrator's setting. However, the user can customize the features again through the UI, which updates their user preference record. If the administrator deletes the user preference record for a particular user, that user's next session uses the system-wide value for that feature. When the user later customizes the feature, the system creates a user preference record for the user. 

##### Global user preferences 

 Create system-wide or global user preferences to set a default preference for your users. To make a preference the default, create a preference, check the System check box, and leave the User field empty. 

##### Important: You should never have more than one preference with the same name set as 

 a global user preference. 

##### User preferences and update sets 

 User preference records for system-wide values, also called the default or global values, are stored in update sets. Any changes are implemented when you import the update set and affect all users who have not customized the feature. User preference records for specific users aren’t 

© 2025 ServiceNow, Inc. All rights reserved. ServiceNow, the ServiceNow logo, Now, and other ServiceNow marks are trademarks and/or registered trademarks of ServiceNow, Inc., in the United States and/or other countries. 534 


 stored in update sets, so user customizations are retained when you import an update set. For more information, see System update sets. 

 User preference settings 

 User preferences primarily track the way individual users interact with various features so that new sessions activate the user's last settings. For example, user preferences track whether the user activates the tabbed or scrolling interface for multi-section forms. Other user preference records enable users with the admin role to adjust certain feature settings. 

##### View settings 

 To view the user preference settings, navigate to User Administration > User Preferences. 

##### User preference list 

 This table describes user preference records in the base system.

 View management 

 A view defines the elements that appear when a user opens a form or a list, and you can switch the view from the default for lists and forms. 

 When the system displays a form or list it usually displays only a subset of the fields belonging to the underlying table. For example, this is the Incident form in the Self-Service View : 

 Self service view 

 This is the Incident form in the Metrics View : 

© 2025 ServiceNow, Inc. All rights reserved. ServiceNow, the ServiceNow logo, Now, and other ServiceNow marks are trademarks and/or registered trademarks of ServiceNow, Inc., in the United States and/or other countries. 548 


 Metrics view 

 Administrators and users with the personalize role have permission to perform the key tasks related to views: 

**-** create views for any list and form 

**-** determine which view is visible by default 

**-** delete views they have created 

**-** create and modify view rules determining which views are available depending on the values     of the fields of the underlying table 

**-** create rules that determine which views pertain to specific user roles 

 Users with the admin or view_changer roles can change views. 

##### Views included with the base system 

 Several views are included with the base system, including the Default view and Advanced view. 

##### Warning: Do not delete any of the base system views. 

© 2025 ServiceNow, Inc. All rights reserved. ServiceNow, the ServiceNow logo, Now, and other ServiceNow marks are trademarks and/or registered trademarks of ServiceNow, Inc., in the United States and/or other countries. 549 


##### Switching views 

 To switch between list views, click the list context menu at the top left corner of the list, and then select Views > [Desired View]. 

 List view list 

 To switch between the list view in list v3, click the context menu, then select Change view > [Desired View]. 

 To switch between form views, click the context menu at the left side of the form header, and then select Views > [Desired View] : 

 Form view list 

###### Switching views submits the form, which saves all changes and triggers any onSubmit client 

 scripts that apply. You cannot switch form views on a new form that has not been saved yet. 

 When a user switches views, the selected view is saved as a user preference so the user sees the same view by default when the form opens. When a user has a view saved as a user preference and then opens a URL to a record that specifies another view, the form displays in the view saved in the user preference, not the URL. For example, if a user selects the Mobile view on an Incident record and then tries to open the following link, which specifies the visual task 

© 2025 ServiceNow, Inc. All rights reserved. ServiceNow, the ServiceNow logo, Now, and other ServiceNow marks are trademarks and/or registered trademarks of ServiceNow, Inc., in the United States and/or other countries. 550 


 board view, the form still opens in the Mobile view: https://{instance}/nav_to.do? uri=incident.do?sys_id={sys_ID}sysparm_view=vtb 

 The sysparm_view parameter specifies the view to be used for a list or a form, and can be overwritten by a user’s stored preference for a view. You can override this behavior by setting the 

###### sysparm_view_forced parameter to true. 

 Create and delete views 

 Administrators can create views and delete any views they have created. You can create or delete views from either the list view or the form view. 

###### Before you begin 

 Role required: admin 

###### Procedure 

**1.** Navigate to the application or module you want to create or delete the view for. 

**2.** If you are creating a view for a list, perform the appropriate action for your list version. 

 Version Action 

 List v2 

 Right-click the header and select Configure > List Layout. 

 List v3 

 Open the context menu and select List Lay out. 

**3.** If you are creating a view for a form, open a record, then right-click the header and select     **Configure** > **Form Layout**. 

**4.** Under the List View section, select the view on which you want to base your new view.     The fields visible for that view appear in the **Selected** list. 

**5.** From the choice list, select **New**.     The Create New View form appears. 

**6.** Enter the descriptive name of the view.     View names should be unique and cannot use special characters or spaces, only the     characters **A-Z** , **a-z** , **0-9** and **_**. 

**7.** Select **OK**.     The fields in the **Available** column are the same as the first view you based the new view on. 

**8.** Select the fields to appear in this view by adding or removing the fields from the **Selected**     column, or you can adjust the order they appear on the form by moving the fields up or down.     If you are creating a view for a form, you can select a form section and configure the fields for     that section. You can also create views in the same manner when you configure a related list. 

**9.** To delete a view, navigate to **System UI** > **Views**. 

**10.** Select the view to delete. 

**11.** Select **Delete** on the form header. 

##### Warning: In the views list, you may see multiple entries formatted as rpt

 temp<sys_id><user>. The instance creates these views to store the current state of reports. Avoid deleting these records, as it may impact the state of active reports. 

 Do not delete the base system views.

 Create a view rule 

 When a user switches views, the selected view is saved as a user preference so the user sees the same view by default when the form opens. With a view rule, you can override this functionality to force a specified view to be used. 

###### Before you begin 

 Role required: admin 

###### About this task 

 View rules do not always apply if there are existing user preference entries on the instance. Delete the user preference entry and clear the system cache to make sure the respective view rule applies. You can clear the system cache by appending cache.do to the instance URL. For example, instance_name.service-now.com/cache.do. 

##### Important: Clearing the system cache can affect overall performance, and degrade 

 system response times. Do not run cache flushes during business hours, and do not trigger cache flushes automatically. 

###### Procedure 

**1.** Navigate to **All** > **System UI** > **View Rules**. 

**2.** Click **New**. 

**3.** Complete the form, using the fields in the table.

 Restrict view by role 

 You can use a script to control the form view used by different roles. 

##### Warning: The customization described here was developed for use in specific instances, 

 and is not supported by Now Support. This method is provided as-is and should be tested thoroughly before implementation. Post all questions and comments regarding this customization to our community forum. 

 Name: Restrict View by Role 

© 2025 ServiceNow, Inc. All rights reserved. ServiceNow, the ServiceNow logo, Now, and other ServiceNow marks are trademarks and/or registered trademarks of ServiceNow, Inc., in the United States and/or other countries. 553 


 Type: System UI > View Rules 

 Table: Any 

 Description: Generally the view used on a form is controlled by either specifying the 

###### sysparm_view parameter in the url or module properties, or by inheriting the view from the 

 previous form or list. Sometimes this does not apply, such as when opening a referenced field form from a record producer. In this case, you may want to control the view of the form based on 

###### roles. This script assumes there is a view called ess available to the current table. 

 Parameters: 

**-** view - A string containing the name of the current view. 

**-** is_list - A Boolean value indicating whether this is a list view. 

 Script: 

 (function overrideView(view, is_list) { //Force non-itil users to use the ess view if (gs.hasRole("itil")) {return;} if (view.startsWith("ess")) {return;} // do not change view if it starts with sys_ (e.g. sys_ref_list) if (view.startsWith("sys_")) {return;} answer = "ess"; // set the new view to answer })(view, is_list); 

 Navigation handler 

 A navigation handler is a scripted view rule and runs each time data from the specified table is requested in the form view. 

##### Create a navigation handler 

 The Navigation Handler [sys_navigator] table contains the navigation handlers on your instance. Access this table by entering sys_navigator.list in the filter navigator. Navigation handler records contain a Table field to specify which table the navigation handler applies to, and a Script field containing the scripted view rule. 

 The following script comes from navigation handler included with the HR plugin. The script forces records from the table in the Table field to use ESS view for users with no roles, and default view for all other users. 

 var now_GR = new GlideRecord(hr.TABLE_CASE); if (gr.get(g_uri.get('sys_id'))) { if (!gs.getUser().hasRoles()) g_uri.set('sysparm_view', 'ess'); else g_uri.set('sysparm_view', ''); } 

 answer = g_uri.toString('hr_case.do'); 

© 2025 ServiceNow, Inc. All rights reserved. ServiceNow, the ServiceNow logo, Now, and other ServiceNow marks are trademarks and/or registered trademarks of ServiceNow, Inc., in the United States and/or other countries. 554 


##### Run navigation handlers before or after view rules 

###### Use the glide.ui.view_rule.check_after_nav_handler system property to control 

 the order in which view rules and navigation handlers are applied. Set the property value to True to process view rules after navigation handlers. If the system property does not exist in your instance, the navigation handler always takes precedence. 

 The system property only overrides the navigation handler if the navigation handler scripted function does not return an answer. In the example script above, the property has no effect. This is because this navigation handler always returns an answer due to the answer line being outside of the if statement. 

 To force the navigation handler script in the preceding example to honor view rules, take the following steps: 

###### 1. Create the glide.ui.view_rule.check_after_nav_handler system property. 

**2.** Set the value of the property to true. 

**3.** Update the navigation handler script to only return an answer when the view must be     changed or forced. 

 This example is a modified version of the previous script. In this case, the answer line only occurs when the user has no roles. If the user has roles, answer is never reached, and view rules on the same table, if any, are applied. 

 var now_GR = new GlideRecord(hr.TABLE_CASE); if (gr.get(g_url.get('sys_id'))) { if (!gs.getUser().hasRoles()) { g_url.set('sysparm_view'),'ess'); answer = g_url.toString('hr_case.do'); } } 

 Welcome pages 

 The welcome page contains instructions and any important information you would like to convey to your customers each time they log in to use the system. 

 The base system login page content is customizable by the administrator of the system. 

##### Note: This information is only relevant for instances using Core UI instead of the Next 

 Experience. For information about similar options available for Next Experience, see Configure login theming in Next Experience.

 Enabling accessibility features 

 You can configure accessibility features globally or for specific users. Users can also individually enable user preferences for themselves to meet their specific accessibility needs. 

 The platform includes features that support Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 AA and WCAG 2.1 AA (for some products) to make the interface more accessible to all users. These features improve the user experience when accessing the instance with screen readers and keyboard navigation. 

 Accessibility features are not enabled by default because some features are user specific. Administrators have the flexibility to enable features globally or for individual users. 

 All of these options can be configured globally or for specific users.

###### Before you begin 

 Role required: admin 

###### About this task 

 Some fields on forms have associated tooltips that contain additional information. By default, these tooltips are accessible by pointing to the field label or mandatory indicator asterisk. However, a user who relies on keyboard navigation cannot point to the field to access the tooltip. The accessible form tooltip feature solves this problem by adding a keyboard-accessible icon next to each field that has a tooltip. Tabbing or pointing to the icon shows the tooltip. Administrators can enable accessible form tooltips for specific users by navigating to User Administration > User Preferences and searching for the glide.ui.accessibility.accessible.tooltips user preference. For more information on configuring user preferences, see User preferences.

 Using accessibility features 

 Accessibility features include keyboard navigation, color and style settings, using a screen reader, and search methods. 

##### Keyboard accessibility 

 The ServiceNow AI Platform is designed to be as accessible as possible without user modification or setting changes. Users can tab through the platform UI without enabling accessibility. However, without accessibility enabled, tabbing goes from input to input and skips other items on a form, such as reference icons. 

 Tab-through provides the following options: 

**-** Use skip links to shift focus to different parts of the page without tabbing through every     element. 

**-** On edit pages such as forms, the keyboard focus starts at the first editable field on the page. 

**-** If the glide.ui.focus_first_element user preference is enabled, page focus starts     at the first input field at the top of the page content section. In a table, this field is usually the     search option. In a form, the field is the first input field in the form. For more information about     disabling initial field focus to improve accessibility, see Turn off first field focus. 

**-** Use tab-through and arrow keys to move items around in a slushbucket. 

**-** When focused on tabs, use right/left arrow keys to switch tabs. 

**-** Arrows keys work within menus to navigate between entries. 

**-** On tab-through for a list, the option to enable the **Edit table data inline** appears, so you can     use the list editor, rather than opening the form. 

 ◦ When inline edit mode is enabled, screen focus shifts to the first cell in the table. 

 ◦ Press the Escape key while a cell is selected to exit inline edit mode. Focus remains on the cell. 

 ◦ Press the spacebar to open the context menu for the selected item. 

 ◦ Use the arrow keys (in addition to tabbing) to move around the list in inline edit mode. 

**-** Properties pages, such as **System Properties** > **UI Properties** , include an icon with the     property name. Screen readers read the property name when the icon is in focus. 

**-** Fields on a form include a tooltip icon. Screen readers read the tooltip when the icon is in     focus. 

**-** In the application navigator when accessibility is enabled, tabbing moves you through each     element for every module, including the **Edit application/module** and **Add to favorites** icons.     Use the arrow keys to move through the application navigator without focusing on these     additional elements. 

**-** If accessibility mode is enabled, a help icon appears with the HTML field. The help icon     indicates how to access and escape the HTML field toolbar. 

 Use skip links 

 Skip links allow users to quickly navigate to the main content on a page, list, or form, bypassing icons, banner text, navigation links, and other elements. Skip links are not visible until you tab to them.

###### About this task 

 The user interface includes skip links to the navigation menu, and the main content pane. If accessibility is not enabled, users can also use skip links to activate accessibility. 

 Skip link 

**- Enable Accessibility** : Enables accessibility. This skip link only appears if the user has not yet     enabled accessibility. Pressing enter prompts you to reload the page with accessibility mode     enabled. 

**- Skip to navigator** : Skips to the navigation filter in the application navigator. 

**- Skip to main content** : Skips to the main content page. 

**- Edit table data inline** : Skips to the first field in a table. When the field is selected, press Enter to     edit the field. Press the spacebar to open the field context menu. Press the Escape key to exit     inline edit mode. 

 Skip links are usually the first item in the tab order for a page or frame. 

###### Procedure 

**-** Use the Tab and Shift+Tab keys to move forward and back through the skip links and other     selectable fields. 

**-** When a skip link receives focus, press Enter to select the link. 

 Color and style accessibility 

 There are several color and style changes that make the platform more accessible. 

##### Enable the Contrast UI theme 

 In the system settings, on the themes tab, select the Contrast UI theme. The Contrast UI theme provides a higher contrast range of colors for the platform UI. 

 In Service Portal, you can apply the Stock — High Contrast theme to a portal for a higher contrast color range. Portal users can enable a contrast theme using the Accessibility option in the User Profile widget. 

##### Patterned charts and graphs 

 View charts and graphs that rely heavily on color with patterns in addition to colors. Navigate to System settings > General , then select Data visualization patterns enabled.

 Accessibility enabled graph 

 Screen reader accessibility 

 Screen elements in the platform have enhancements that make them accessible to screen readers. 

 Use NVDA, JAWS, or VoiceOver for non-visual access to the platform. 

 Skip links allow you to tab straight to the main content instead of tabbing through all the other elements on the page. 

 When a page reloads or search results display, screen readers inform the user. 

 Important images and field indicators (for example, status indicators for avatars in list v3) have alternative text for screen readers to read. 

 To reduce confusion when tabbing through modules, the edit application/edit module and add to favorites icons are accessible to screen readers by tabbing. To skip the Edit application/module and Add to favorites icons, use the up and down arrows on the keyboard. 

 In Service Portal, users can add alternative text to containers in their own portal for screen readers to read. 

 Elements such as links or button are listed as such for screen reader awareness. 

 Properties pages, such as System Properties > UI Properties , include an icon with the property name. Screen readers read the property name when the icon is in focus. 

 Forms include accessible tooltips that screen readers read when the tooltip is in focus. 

 Accessibility search methods 

 There are several ways to search for information in the user interface. 

© 2025 ServiceNow, Inc. All rights reserved. ServiceNow, the ServiceNow logo, Now, and other ServiceNow marks are trademarks and/or registered trademarks of ServiceNow, Inc., in the United States and/or other countries. 563 


**-** When a list opens, focus starts in the search field. Press the Tab key or the shift+tab keys to     navigate away from the search, or start typing while focus is in the search field. 

**-** List views include a **Go to** search field in the list title bar. Using the * wildcard character in the     search text allows you to perform a **contains** search rather than a **starts with** search. This     type of query may take longer to run but can save keystrokes. You can also use several other     wildcards with list searches. 

**-** The navigation filter in the application navigator filters the applications and modules that     appear in the navigator based on the entered text. Tab through or use skip links to navigate     directly to the navigation filter. To open a module, click the module name, or press the Down     Arrow to highlight the module name, and then press Enter. 

 See Available search options for more information about these search methods. 

 View card details in a Visual Task Board 

 With accessibility mode enabled, tab through cards in a task board. Use the card details button to view task card details. 

###### Before you begin

 Map pages 

 Map pages display ServiceNow data graphically on a Google map page based on location data that you provide. 

 You can create as many map pages as required to define the types of data to display, the links to show, and the appearance of the map. After creating the map pages, you can create modules to display the map pages. 

##### Note: Map pages are subject to the non-production access limitations. See Set up Google 

 Maps API for details. 

##### Map locations 

 Locations are used by various applications to locate users, facilities, or configuration items (CI) and are stored in the Location [cmn_location] table. You can configure different levels of location in a parent-child hierarchy. For example, an email server might be associated with a location of Second Floor, whereas the email business service might be associated with New York City. 

 Each level of this hierarchy contains a separate location record, with the next higher level specified as a parent. In this example each location is selectable as a hierarchy from reference fields: 

 Location hierarchy 

 The location is also used to generate a full identifier in the Full name field, which is available by configuring the form. For more information, see Show or hide fields on a form. 

##### How locations are defined 

 To create a location, navigate to User Administration > Locations and select New.

 Customizing instance appearance 

 An administrator can change global CSS or system properties to alter the look and feel of the default instance interface. Functionality is not affected. 

 For example, organizations often use multiple instances to separate development, testing, and production activities. To help users avoid accidentally changing the wrong instance, administrators can configure each with a visually distinct theme. Several approaches are available for defining an instance theme.

**-** Get the brand color hex or RGB numbers of your company, typically from your marketing     department. Use them to decide how to configure the UI background colors. 

 Role required: admin 

###### About this task

 Examples of how to modify the banner 

 There are various ways that you can modify the banner on your instances. 

##### Note: From the San Diego release on, configure banner announcements instead of 

###### updating glide.product.description. For more information, see Configure Next 

 Experience banner announcements. 

##### Label multiple instances differently

**-** On PROD instance, set glide.product.name to <My Company> 

**-** On DEV instance, set glide.product.name to <My Company - DEV>

###### glide.product.description, the following gives you complete control over the banner 

 and the window title. 

**-** glide.product.name set to <Window Title that you want> 

**-** glide.product.name.style set to <display: none> 

**-** glide.product.description set to <blank>

##### Use HTML in the banner text 

**-** glide.product.name set to <My Company> 

**-** glide.product.name.style set to <display: none> 

**-** glide.product.description set to <Some text <a href="some_url">Click here</a>>

**-** glide.product.name set to <My Company> 

**-** glide.product.name.style set to <display: none> 

**-** glide.product.image set to <your company logo.gif> 

**-** glide.product.description set to <Some text for the description> 

**-** glide.product.description.style set to <position:absolute; top:5px; left:100px>     (position values may vary based on specified needs) 

##### Apply a background image to the banner 

 Often corporate guidelines require more in-depth branding of the ServiceNow interface. Using the tiling technique, you can modify your logo image to have a transparent background, so that you can apply another image to the banner beneath the logo. 

 Upload an image to the image manager and then create a new property named 

###### css.banner.background.image, so that you can call the image. The value should look 

 like this. 

###### css.banner.background.image value url('./images/MasterBG.jpgx') 

##### Write CSS rules that apply this change 

 /** BACKGROUND These properties allow you use to add a background tile to the header of the instance ***************************/ TD.bannerLeft,TD.bannerCenter,TD.bannerRight, TR#banner_row{background-color: ${banner.background.color}; background-image: ${banner.background.image}; background-position: ${banner.background.position}; background-repeat: ${banner.background.repeat};} 

##### Note: The banner image and banner text associated with the primary company 

###### or specific companies may be used instead of the glide.product.image and 

###### glide.product.description properties to get the same effect. 

 Modify the banner 

 The banner is displayed at the top of the page and is rendered using certain system properties. 

##### Note: From the San Diego release on, configure banner announcements instead of 

###### updating glide.product.description, which is not used when Next Experience is 

 enabled.

**4.** Click **Update**. 

#### Content Management System 

 The Content Management System (CMS) is a ServiceNow application that enables users to create a custom interface for the ServiceNow platform and ServiceNow applications. 

##### Important: Use Service Portal for new development instead of CMS. Service Portal is 

 an alternative to CMS with a refined user experience, and is active by default in the base system. For more information, see Service Portal and Content Management and Service Portal. 

 A CMS typically requires a systems administrator or a web developer to set up and add features. Non-technical users can use the CMS application as a tool for website maintenance. You also want to consider the timing of the addition of content management, and the maturity level of ServiceNow data. For more information, see CMS Planning. 

 Following are several CMS project ideas: 

**-** Design a company-wide service catalog that offers a collection of services. 

**-** Present a customized UI for a knowledge base. 

**-** Create customized login pages, search pages, views of lists, tables, charts, or graphs. 

© 2025 ServiceNow, Inc. All rights reserved. ServiceNow, the ServiceNow logo, Now, and other ServiceNow marks are trademarks and/or registered trademarks of ServiceNow, Inc., in the United States and/or other countries. 609 


**-** Design a complete website. 

**-** Integrate ServiceNow with other company applications. 

**-** Build a tailored self-service portal for end users that is in compliance with a corporate style     guide. 

##### Example CMS sites 

 There are two common interface approaches within the ServiceNow community: 

**-** An image and text-based interface similar to Amazon.com 

**-** A search-based interface similar to Google 

 Both approaches have been used successfully. The approach you select depends on the needs of the people using the data and how easy it is to train them. While the two design philosophies are different, both approaches share the common goal of UI simplicity. 

##### Content Management design 

 Before building a website in the CMS, it is important to have a good understanding of what to build and who the audience is. 

 A high volume of content can heavily influence the look and feel of the site and the site hierarchy. When deciding the content, design for ease of maintenance for the people who take care of the system. This level of planning can be time-consuming, but is important. 

 Review website design prerequisites to help you set expectations, scope deliverables, and define reasonable time lines. Consider both the planning and execution of site design, to understand how sites are built, and to provide a working overview of the CMS. 

 Timing is important when considering the addition of content management. Successful deployments of the content management system usually take place after phase 1 processes (for example, Incident, Problem, Change, Catalog, and Knowledge) are in place. This is especially true if the team has limited website design experience. Waiting until phase 2 of deployment gives administrators time to work in ServiceNow and to understand how the organization uses the system and what business needs it meets. 

 Also consider the maturity level of data in the ServiceNow system. Depending on the ITIL processes used, content management is only useful and effective once the data within ServiceNow is established. Ensure that hierarchies, tasks, and workflows are well-defined. For example, before creating a catalog interface, confirm that the service catalog has been in place for some time, has been used, and contains data. The same is true for a knowledge management interface, particularly when high ratings or view counts define article placement on the page. 

 Content organization 

 Before you begin to build the CMS website, list all the content that you want to include and take the time to organize it. 

 A site created in CMS relies on two different types of content. 

**-** CMS site information, such as site pages, images, and menus 

**-** System information, such as knowledge base articles and catalog items

##### CMS content 

 Begin by listing all the content you want to host on the CMS pages. Examples include help pages, My Requests, My Approvals, and specific catalog items. Think about current solutions that you can implement immediately, and note ideas for future implementation phases. 

 Within CMS, you group pages to define the top-down menu structure. You establish a home or starting page, and other pages in the site reference the home page in the Parent Page reference field. 

 There are several ways to group, such as by audience or the purpose of the website. After listing the content to host, group it logically and identify a common name for each group, as shown in the following examples. 

 IT environment groups 

 Content built for Common name 

 End user End User Page 

 IT professional IT Professional Page 

 General groups 

 Purpose of site Common name 

 Reports Reporting Page 

 Help and knowledge Knowledge page 

##### System content 

 Organize the content so the interface is easy to navigate and understandable to the user. Determine the organization based on the data that you are leveraging, both in the CMS (using sites, parent pages, pages, and navigational menus) and throughout the rest of the system. For example, within the catalog you have "category," and in the knowledge base you have "category" and "subcategory." You can use these hierarchies with filtered lists for good search results. 

 Organizing CMS content logically is important for long-term maintenance of the site, however, the data typically comes from other ServiceNow applications. Communicate with the administrators for these applications, such as the knowledge base, service catalog, and business service portfolio. Work with them to offer the application data appropriately through the CMS pages you create. For example, the team that created the ServiceNow corporate website in CMS began by evaluating the naming conventions used in the corporate knowledge base. 

##### Branding elements 

 Branding refers to the logo, name, colors, and symbols that identify an organization. It imposes consistency in design and use of terms. Your marketing department defines branding elements and can provide them to you as you plan your CMS pages. Consider how to incorporate the following branding elements. 

**-** Logos 

**-** Color palette 

**-** Tag line 

© 2025 ServiceNow, Inc. All rights reserved. ServiceNow, the ServiceNow logo, Now, and other ServiceNow marks are trademarks and/or registered trademarks of ServiceNow, Inc., in the United States and/or other countries. 611 


**-** Trademarked elements 

**-** Graphics 

##### Site design 

 During planning, consider providing a core set of features with a standard appearance throughout the site. The following web design elements are often used to create a consistent look. 

**-** Page templates 

**-** Navigation schemes 

**-** Header 

**-** Breadcrumbs 

**-** Footer 

**-** Forms 

##### ServiceNow features 

 Analyze and organize the following ServiceNow features in your instance if you plan on using any of them with CMS pages. 

**-** Account settings 

**-** Email 

**-** Workflow approvals 

**-** Filters 

 Team member identification 

 Identify the team members who assist you with website design, branding, and development. 

 Engage team members for each listed function before you begin to build pages for the CMS website. Each function can be performed by the same or different people. 

**-** Gather corporate style design guidelines. 

**-** Define the written terminology and content for the site. 

**-** Gather and define the site flow. 

**-** Manage the CMS project as the webmaster. The CMS webmaster is responsible for executing     the design and making the site work. The following skills are required: 

 ◦ Basic ServiceNow administration skills 

 ◦ HTML 

 ◦ CSS 

 ◦ Graphic design 

 ◦ Web design 

 After you identify the project team members, establish who is responsible to complete the tasks involved in building the CMS website.

**-** Determine who owns each page. 

**-** Set a page update schedule so owners do not overwrite each other. 

**-** Formalize content management processes, including content review and page updates. 

 Data preparation 

 It is important that there is enough data in the ServiceNow instance before you begin to build the CMS website. 

 Ensure that the necessary data and content are available in the instance by taking the following actions. 

**-** Review the ITIL processes that you intend to implement in the CMS. Ensure that the data in     the instance is a mature representation of the applications being used, for example, service     catalog, knowledge management, and incident management. 

**-** Review the defined hierarchies, such as the categories and subcategories for the knowledge     base or service catalog. You use these categories to design the entry page into the application. 

 Corporate style guide 

 When you build a CMS website, you design the look and feel based on guidelines in the corporate style guide. 

 A corporate style guide provides detailed information for designing any corporate interface, including corporate websites. 

 Corporate design team 

 Many organizations have a web development team that designed the corporate website. Contact this team and involve the designers early in the planning, as they provide help and give their approval to the interface you design. Without approval, there is the risk of having to redesign the entire site because it does not adhere to the organizational guidelines. 

 Corporate style guide 

 A corporate style guide takes the guesswork out of designing the CMS website. The example style guide shown is defined down to the pixel. Creating a site with the style guide makes it easy to create clean CSS and HTML. Without the style guide, building the site can take a great deal of time. 

 Design considerations 

 Some modifications to the base design for forms may be necessary. The content area of any CMS design should be no smaller than 860px, or service catalog forms are clipped. The sample style guide entry specifies the content area to be 576px, which clips service catalog forms.

 Example style guide entry 

 Prototypes and rapid web design 

 Many user interface designers use prototypes and rapid web design techniques to visualize the final product before it is developed. 

 Design revisions are the most time consuming and expensive phase of site design. When the team analyzes and then uses prototypes to create pages, revisions to the published pages are minimal. 

 Develop the prototype and print it. Review the design with the appropriate team members and annotate the prototype, and annotate what to update on each page. 

 Define the following elements within the prototype.

**-** The site map for the entire site. 

**-** A detailed prototype of every intended page, including elements such as links, link     destinations, content, page names, and page descriptions. 

 Content Management navigation 

 After you design the hierarchical structure of the site, begin planning site navigation. 

 Consider the following as you plan site navigation. 

**-** Placing navigation elements on every page. 

**-** Locating navigation elements in the same place on every page. 

**-** Using either text or images for navigation. 

**-** Providing visitors with an easy way to understand where they are in the site, for example, with     breadcrumbs or a specific color scheme. 

**-** Adding a site map, which is a one-page, hyperlinked, hierarchical outline of the site. 

**-** Providing a link to the home page from every site page, as visitors often enter the site on a     page other than the home page. 

**-** Designing navigation to help visitors find information quickly with as few clicks as possible. 

 In the CMS, navigation menus define your site navigation. Build menus as navigational blocks to create navigation paths. The menu chosen for the task depends on the size and complexity of your site. Available menu options include the following items. 

**-** List menus 

**-** Two types of tab menus 

**-** Vertical, clickable list, usually placed on the left side 

**-** Horizontal blocks 

**-** Vertical blocks 

**-** Super menu (a menu of menus) 

 System content management 

 Most of the content in a CMS site is managed in different locations throughout the system. 

 For example, if you are building a knowledge website, the pages and blocks exist in CMS, but the knowledge articles are authored and managed in the Knowledge application. The same is true for any other type of content you plan to leverage. It is important to take time to understand the table structure of data to become acquainted with content. 

 Links to content are typically static, however, take time to look at the document tree and review how field values are formatted for use within the CMS. To understand the information provided below, right-click within forms in the platform and select Show XML to view the document tree for the referenced table. To see the table values for each field, right-click the form label and choose Show (field name) or Configure Dictionary for reference. 

 Look at several internet news sites for ideas on how to format dynamic list data and also the full article detail. Research blog sites, shopping sites, and any other site you find easy to use, as layout and usability design can be time-consuming. If you find a site that inspires you, emulate it in your design.

**-** This New York Times example has two separate list formats. 

**-** The CNN example has several list formats on the page. 

**-** Several different list formats are used on the ServiceNow website. 

##### Knowledge articles kb_knowledge table 

 When you right-click and select Show XML on any form within the system, the document tree for the referenced database table becomes reference-able. Review the following selected subset of the document tree so you can acquaint yourself with the content readily available to your site design. 

 <kb_knowledge> <active>true </active> <author display_value= "First Last Name" >Use this field value if author name is important </author> <short_description>Use this field value as the link to the full article detail </short_description> <description>Provide this field value as a 1-2 sentence summary of the article </description> <number>Unique ID can be leveraged in a number of different ways </number> <published>Published time stamp of the article </published> <rating>This field value provides a 1 to 5 star rating similar to iTunes </rating> <sys_updated_on>Add to supplement article published timestamp </sys_updated_on> <sys_view_count>8 </sys_view_count> <topic>Useful field value in creating hierarchical breadcrumbs </topic> <category>Also useful in organizing articles hierarchically </category> <use_count>Use this similar to Facebook's "like" feedback, answer to the question was this useful </use_count> </ kb_knowledge>

##### Domain separation and the Content Management System 

 Domain separation is supported in the Content Management System. Domain separation enables you to separate data, processes, and administrative tasks into logical groupings called domains. You can control several aspects of this separation, including which users can see and access data. 

##### Support level: No support 

**-** The domain field may exist on data tables but there is no business logic to manage the data. 

**-** This level is not considered domain-separated. 

 For more information on support levels, see Application support for domain separation.

 The site is the container that holds all the content. To simplify your process, you can copy an existing site and edit its components. For more information on creating a site, see Create a site. For more information on copying a site, see Copy a site. 

**3.** Add pages to the site.     Pages contain blocks of information for the site. For more information, see Create a content     page. 

**4.** Create content blocks to customize the layout, headers, menu navigation, lists, and static and     dynamic content.     Content blocks are chunks of actual HTML that make up the content page. There are various     content block types available to help with your customization. For more information, see     Content blocks. 

**5.** Add style to your site using themes, style sheets, and frames.     Neither content sites or content pages reference style sheets directly. Configure them using     the Themes or Style Sheets options. For more information, see Style in Content Management. 

**6.** Test the site.     After you create or modify a site, test the site to ensure that content displays properly and all     links work correctly. For more information, see Test the site.

###### Procedure 

**1.** Navigate to **All** > **Content Management** > **Sites**. 

**2.** Click **New**. 

**3.** Complete the form.     Since you have not yet created pages, you cannot select the Home, Search, Login, and Gauge     target pages. Add them to the site record after you create them. 

 Site fields 

 Field Description 

 Name A unique name for the site. 

 URL suffix The URL suffix that identifies the site. The URL suffix is case-sensitive, the suffix you enter impacts the CMS site URL used to launch the site. It is incorporated into the URL as follows: 

 http://<instance name>.service-now.com/url_suffix/ page.do 

##### Note: Do not use portal and cms in the URL suffix. They are reserved 

 terms and return a Page not found if you use them. 

 Home page 

 The page to display when the user does not specify a page name in their URL: 

 http://<instance name>.service-now.com/url_suffix/ 

 Search page 

 The page that displays search results when a user searches from any page within the site. 

 Login page The page to use for logging in to the site. If specified, users must log in to access the pages on the site. If left blank, no login is required to access the pages within the site. 

 Gauge target page 

 The page that displays gauge content. When the user clicks a gauge on the new site, the gauge target page opens to show the gauge content. The gauge target page replaces the CMS page in the current tab. 

 Title A title for the site. The title can be the same as or different from the Name. 

 Description A full description of the site. 

 Default layout 

 The layout for pages to use by default. Any page in the site that has a blank Layout field uses the layout selected in this field. 

 Default theme 

 The theme for pages to use by default. Any page in the site that has a blank Theme field uses the theme selected in this field.

 Copy a site 

 To create a new site quickly, you can copy an existing site. 

###### Before you begin 

 Role required: content_admin or admin 

###### About this task 

 The site copy option creates a complete standalone copy of the site and all its resources. If you are copying a site to create a second site, use this option after the first site is complete, tested, and production ready. This consideration is important because the blocks, CSS, and pages are

 duplicated to support the new site. There are various reasons why site copying is useful, such as site versioning, branding, or creating a backup. 

 Images are not included when you use the Copy Site option. They are stored separately in the sys_attachments table. 

 To copy just a few pages without duplicating all the resources (CSS, blocks, menus), use the page copy option. Page copy duplicates the page but not the resources used in the page. For more information, see Copy a page. 

###### Procedure 

**1.** Navigate to **All** > **Content Management** > **Sites** > **[Site Name]**. 

**2.** On the Site form, click **Copy**. 

**3.** In the dialog box that opens, type a name for the new site.     This name is a prefix for all the site elements that are duplicated. Do not use **Portal** or **CMS** in     the site name. 

 A progress bar shows the copy process. When the process is complete, the Site form shows information for the new site.

 Content Management security 

 There are several methods for securing CMS sites and pages. Site security is set in the Login page field on the site record. You can control if a page is public or private through the URL. 

 Every content page has its own URL that users can access outside of the platform. Depending on how the Login page or roles are defined, the URL may or may not be public. 

**-** If the content page has no defined **Read** role or there is no defined Login page, any internet     user can navigate to the URL and view the content page. 

**-** If there is a defined **Read** role, then anyone who goes to the URL is asked to log in before they     can view the site. 

**-** If there is a defined Login page on the site record, all pages in the site are private. 

##### Content Management URLs 

 The format for Content Management URLs is as follows. 

 <path to the instance> + /<site suffix> + /<page suffix> + .do 

 The <site suffix> is defined by the URL Suffix field on the site form. The <page suffix> is defined by the URL Suffix field in the page form. The URL suffix is case-sensitive. 

 For example, the page Austere Site Entry has a site URL Suffix of austere and a page URL Suffix of entry. The constructed URL looks like the following URL. 

 <instance name>.service-now.com/austere/entry.do 

 If the site URL Suffix field is left blank, the <site suffix> is cms , as shown in this example: 

 instance.service-now.com/cms/page.do 

 If the page URL Suffix is left blank, the name of the page is used as shown in this example: 

© 2025 ServiceNow, Inc. All rights reserved. ServiceNow, the ServiceNow logo, Now, and other ServiceNow marks are trademarks and/or registered trademarks of ServiceNow, Inc., in the United States and/or other countries. 621 


 instance.service-now.com/austere/Page Name.do 

 Special characters in the name of the page have to be escaped. 

##### Login pages instead of login rules 

 You set a login page on the site record to allow users to log in or out directly through the content site. 

 Login rules were used in earlier versions to dictate what users saw after logging in, based on their roles or permissions. Login rules still work, but their use is deprecated. 

 Configure CMS sites to use single sign-on (SSO) 

 To configure CMS to use SSO, make the view_content page private. 

###### Before you begin 

 Role required: content_admin or admin 

###### About this task 

 Because public pages do not require login, and CMS sites are public by default, CMS pages do not use SSO. Use the following procedure to turn off public-facing content pages and enable SSO. 

###### Procedure 

**1.** Navigate to Public Pages [sys_public.list]. 

**2.** For the view_content page, set **Active** to **false**. 

 Content pages in CMS 

 Content pages are the core of the Content Management System. A content page is a web page that displays blocks of content. 

 Pages are built from content blocks and organized into sites. Pages display as regular webpages that are rendered in HTML. Constructing a content page requires a basic knowledge of HTML. Content pages are formed by arranging content blocks in predefined layouts. They can be used to present login pages, search pages, or ServiceNow content.

 Page form fields 

 Field Description 

 Name A unique name for the page. 

© 2025 ServiceNow, Inc. All rights reserved. ServiceNow, the ServiceNow logo, Now, and other ServiceNow marks are trademarks and/or registered trademarks of ServiceNow, Inc., in the United States and/or other countries. 622 


 Field Description 

 Prefix each page name with the name of the site followed by a dash and the page function. For example, ESS Catalog Detail and ESS Search Results are page names within the ESS site. 

 URL suffix The URL suffix that identifies the page. It is incorporated into the URL as follows: 

 http://instance name.service-now.com/site/ url_suffix.do 

 Parent page 

 The existing page that is the parent of the current page. Parent pages keep sections sortable on the site list of pages and are used to create breadcrumbs dynamically. Use CSS to define menus that give the Parent page context within the user interface. 

 Layout The layout to use for the page. Layouts define dropzones where content blocks can be added to the page. 

 If this field is left blank, the page inherits the default layout of the site. If the site does not have a default layout, there is a single dropzone for the entire page. 

 Content theme 

 The theme to use for the page. Themes bundle CSS style sheets that are applied to all content within the page. 

 If this field is left blank, the page inherits the default theme of the site. Use the default theme unless the page requires a different set of CSS style sheets from the other pages in the site. 

 Frame buster 

 Select the check box to remove any restrictions placed by frames that contain the page. This way you avoid frame-within-frame issues that sometimes occur with improper linking. 

 Content site 

 The site associated with the content page. If you created the page from the related list in the site, the value defaults. The content site provides the <site_suffix> in the page URL, as follows: 

 http://<instance name>.service-now.com/site_suffix/ page_suffix.do 

 Read roles Users with the selected roles can view the page. Click the lock icon to select roles. 

 Model document 

 A document ID of a record to display by default. 

 Page status 

 The status for the page, such as Draft or Published. 

 Created by The user who created the page. If your role has higher privileges than your user name and you enter your user name, the field defaults to the role. For example, if you are logged in as an Admin and you type your name, which has lower privileges, this field displays Admin. 

 Title The title for the page. The title displays on the browser tab when the page is accessed.

 With single sign-on (SSO) in place, you can generate email links that take users directly to tickets and applications through the CMS interface. 

###### Before you begin 

 Role required: content_admin or admin 

###### About this task 

 You accomplish this procedure by creating a private UI page to redirect CMS links. Because the page is not public, it requires authentication and redirects to SSO appropriately.

###### Procedure 

**1.** Check that your CMS site is private by completing the following steps. 

 a. Navigate to Content Management > Sites > [Your Site] 

 b. Verify that the Login page field has a page listed. 

**2.** Create a new UI page by completing the following steps. 

 a. Navigate to System UI > UI Pages. 

 b. Click New. 

 c. Enter a Name , for example, redirector. 

 d. Enter the following Adobe Jelly code into the HTML field. 

 <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?><j:jelly trim="true" xmlns:j="jelly:core" xmlns:g="glide" xmlns:j2="null" xmlns:g2="null"><script type="script/javascript"> window.location.href="${sysparm_uri}";</script></j:jelly> 

 The CMS now supports email links with following format: 

 http://<path to instance>/<UI page>.do?uri=/<CMS suffix>/ <record type>.do%26sys_id=<record ID> 

 For example: 

 http://<instance name>.service-now.com/ redirector.do?sysparm_uri=/ess/incident.do %26sys_id=46e3e949a9fe19810069b824ba2c761a 

##### Note: If you are using SAML 2.0 update 1 for SSO, use the UI page saml_redirector 

 instead of creating a new UI page. For example, an email link to a SAML 2.0 redirector page would use the URL format: http://<instance name>.servicenow.com/ saml_redirector.do ?sysparm_uri=/ess/incident.do %26sys_id=46e3e949a9fe19810069b824ba2c761a. 

 Content Management templates 

 Templates are content pages that are reused to provide a consistent look and feel. 

 Templates are useful when creating CMS sites for the following reasons. 

 Create new pages rapidly without risk by copying pages 

 Using a template to create new pages saves time because you do not have to keep repeating the same steps. 

 Provide a restore point for pages within the system 

 Have a working template available if something goes wrong in one of the blocks or in the theme CSS. It is often easier to start over from the template instead of trying to undo complex changes.

 (continued) 

 Provide a functional reference for editors on the site project 

 Having the template as a reference ensures that pages continue to conform to the style guide. 

 Page templates 

 Every page that is part of the site needs a template. 

##### Critical page reference fields 

 When you build a new site, there are four page reference fields on the site record that are critical. Understanding these pages and how they are used helps you define page templates and site defaults. 

**-** Home page: landing page for the site. A home page is mandatory. 

**-** Search page: page that displays search results when a user searches from any page within the     site. A search page is mandatory for your site to have a Search Results block. 

**-** Login page: a standalone login page, which is useful to force authentication for the entire CMS     site. 

**-** Gauge target page: page used to display the drill-through content from a gauge. When the user     clicks a gauge, the gauge target page opens showing the drill-through content for that gauge. 

 Critical page reference fields 

##### Detail pages 

 Depending on the data or tables that you plan to use, you may need detail pages. These detail pages use one of the content types in the following list. 

**-** Knowledge detail page: displays a full knowledge article detail (mandatory for a knowledge     site). 

**-** Incident page: detail page for an incident record. 

**-** Catalog page: detail page for all items, content items, order guides, and record producers. 

##### Templates for creating sections 

 There are two page templates you can use when creating sections: 

© 2025 ServiceNow, Inc. All rights reserved. ServiceNow, the ServiceNow logo, Now, and other ServiceNow marks are trademarks and/or registered trademarks of ServiceNow, Inc., in the United States and/or other countries. 628 


**-** Parent page: keeps sections within large sites organized and sortable on the site list of pages.     Parent pages are also used to create breadcrumbs dynamically. 

**-** Detail page: differs from the parent page in that the content area displays a full article or detail     instead of a selection of related content. Detail pages must have a Current Document block. 

 These pages are mandatory if you plan on accessing system data. For example, if you plan on showing the service catalog in your CMS, you need the following items. 

**-** A service catalog content type that references the [sc_cat_item table]. 

**-** A detail page that provides the full view of the item. 

##### New templates 

 If the base system sample site pages are not suitable, you can create a template from scratch. Create a page and then use it as a template. For more information, see Create a Content Page. 

 When you save a new template, include the word "template" in the page name. 

 Configure a base template 

 An easy way to create a base template is to copy the existing ESS sample site and customize it to suit your own needs. You can also configure a base template from scratch. 

###### Before you begin 

 Role required: content_admin or admin 

###### About this task 

 Follow these steps to create a single base page and generate all important components within the site. 

###### Procedure 

**1.** Design a layout.     Regardless of the interface, a site can be distilled into a few simple layouts. 

**2.** Create a theme.     The theme defines the structure of the layouts in CSS and the base styles, such as fonts and     colors. For more information, see Design themes. 

**3.** Build the common blocks.     Pages are composed of content blocks. Most content blocks are reused on multiple pages.     For the base template, create basic blocks such as a header, side navigation, and some basic     content for the main content area of the page. More detailed content can be added later, but     define content for reuse on many of the site pages here. For more information, see Content     blocks. 

**4.** Build a site entry page.     Use the common content blocks you just created to design the first page that users see when     they enter the site. For more information, see Create a content page. 

**5.** Build a detail page.     Design the detail pages to determine how pages such as knowledge articles, catalog items,     and search results are displayed. You can build a detail page by copying the site entry page     and adding additional content blocks. For more information, see Copy a page. 

**6.** Assign the pages created to the new site.     Create the site and apply the layout and theme to the site defaults. Then, navigate to the **All**     **Pages** list and specify the base template site in the **Site** column for each of the base template     pages. For more information, see Create a site.

 Customize a copy of a page template 

 One good source for templates is the base system sample site. It is easy to copy pages and restyle them into new page templates to meet different business requirements. 

###### Before you begin 

 Role required: content_admin or admin 

 The Employee Self-Service portal is provided as a working example and design template in the following procedure. 

###### Procedure 

**1.** Navigate to **All** > **Content Management** > **Sites** > **Employee Self-Service**. 

**2.** Select a page.     For example, to copy the ESS sample site homepage, select Portal. 

**3.** Click **Copy**. 

**4.** Rename the page. 

**5.** Right-click in the header and select **Save**. 

**6.** Under **Related Links** , click **Edit Page**. 

**7.** Point your cursor to the content block to change and click the edit icon that appears on the     right.     For example, change the menus, alter the layout, or add a different logo. 

**8.** Click **Update**. 

**9.** Use the page in other sites you created by assigning pages to a site. 

 Content types 

 Content types provide site-specific control of how system data defined by templates is rendered. 

 In the site, one page displays a list of knowledge articles, and another page displays catalog items or incidents or a combination of the two. Different themes can be used for types of content and each theme can provide different user interaction. Content types define the pages that display content from a table. Each content type corresponds to a table. 

 Every type of document that the CMS displays has an associated content type. Changing the content type requires knowledge of Apache Jelly scripting. However, the common content types (such as service catalog or knowledge base) come in the base system. Content types can be associated with particular sites. This association allows different sites to use different detail pages for the same content type. 

 Content types define three features of associated documents. 

**-** What does a link to one of these documents look like? For example, if a list of these documents     is displayed on a page, how does each entry appear? 

**-** What does a detailed view of one of these documents look like? 

**-** What detail page is used to display the document? This decision is important and is often an     area of confusion for new CMS users. 

 The document content type determines the page that a list of documents points to, the list itself does not determine the page. The content from a link is displayed in a detail content block on a page. The content type determines in which detail block on a page the document content is displayed.

 For example, the list block Catalog Top 5 displays the top five items in the Service Catalog table [sc_cat_item]. Because the table is [sc_cat_item], the content type sc_cat_item controls how the Catalog Top 5 list is displayed. Clicking any item in the list displays the Service Catalog Detail page with the item displayed on it according to the detail template script. These content types are applied: 

**-** in search results to link to the correct page. 

**-** in the Current Document block to display the current record. 

**-** in links on lists and other places that link to record types. 

 Several content types are available by default for tables such as Catalog Item [sc_cat_item], Gauge [sys_gauge], and Page [content_page]. 

 Content type defaults that are set for CMS can be overridden for individual sites. Use the Content Types related list on the site record to customize content types. 

 Configure a content type 

 Users with the content_admin role can create a content type. 

###### Before you begin 

 Role required: content_admin or admin

 A gauge might, for example, show a bar chart breaking down all open incidents by category. Gauges are fully supported within the CMS system. This means: 

**1.** You can put a gauge on a CMS page 

**2.** You can control what will happen when a user clicks on a cell within that gauge 

 Put a gauge on a CMS page 

 You have control over the gauges on a CMS page. 

###### Before you begin 

 Role required: content_admin or admin 

###### Procedure 

**1.** Bring up the CMS page in edit mode. 

**2.** Click **Add Content**. 

**3.** Select the gauge you want to add. 

**4.** Place the gauge on the page in the desired location.

 Control what happens on a click 

 Control what happens on a click 

 Since a CMS system uses multiple pages you have to tell the system which page to use to display drill through content. 

 In the normal (non CMS) system, when you click a bar in a bar chart or a wedge on a pie chart, you drill through and your current screen is replaced with a list of records meeting the chart's criteria. For example, if you have a gauge of Incidents by Category and you click the bar labeled Hardware you drill through to a list of all incidents with a category=hardware. 

 Within the CMS system, there is a similar drill through mechanism at work, but you must manually specify which page to display. 

 There are two different models of the drill through, use an in-place target frame to receive the content, or use another page to display the content. 

##### Using an In-Place Target 

 An in-place target is a named iframe on the same CMS page as the gauge. When the gauge is clicked, the drill-through content appears within that iframe rather than changing out the CMS page. The gauge (and the rest of the page other than the target) remain in place and active. 

##### Using a Gauge Target Page 

 A gauge target page is a separate CMS page that is used to display the drill-through content from a gauge. When a gauge is clicked, the current CMS page is replaced with the gauge target page and the drill-through content is rendered within that second page. 

**- Gauge Target Page** 

 To set a site default, select Gauge Target Page , on the site configuration page. This page is used as the drill-through target for any gauges in the system that do not have a more specific gauge page specified in their content type. 

© 2025 ServiceNow, Inc. All rights reserved. ServiceNow, the ServiceNow logo, Now, and other ServiceNow marks are trademarks and/or registered trademarks of ServiceNow, Inc., in the United States and/or other countries. 632 


**- Gauge Page** 

 To set a content-type specific page, you can specify a Gauge Page , on a content type page. Any gauges for this type of content then use that page for any drill through. 

##### Note: The gauge target on a particular content type overrides the default, site level, 

 gauge target. 

**- Gauge Target block** 

 A gauge target page is a normal CMS page, with one special requirement. Somewhere on that page, there must be a Gauge Target block. This market block tells the system where to output the drill through data.

 The following is an example of where you might use Content Types. 

###### Before you begin 

 This example uses the out-of-box Employee Self-Service (ESS) site as an example. Role required: content_admin or admin 

###### About this task 

 Use any out-of-box instance of a CMS site. 

###### Procedure 

**1.** Launch an out-of-box CMS site https://<instance name>.service-now.com/     ess. 

**2.** Under Get Help, click **Issue Status**.     The Issue Status, or incident_status CMS page contains two content blocks: Common Answer     and Current Issues. These content blocks both use Content Types to render results. 

**3.** From https://<instance name>.service-now.com, navigate to **Blocks** > **Lists** >     **Portal - Common Answers**.     This block matches the Common Answers section of the Issue Status page. The Table field     describes the Content Type associated with Common Answers. 

**4.** Use the link to view existing Content Types. 

**5.** Click the Content Type to view the XML that determines how the list and record are rendered in     CMS.     The Default Detail Page field indicates a CMS page that displays a record selected from a List     of Content block. 

**6.** Click the Information icon next to the Default Detail Page, to go to that page. 

**7.** From the Default Detail Page, under Related Links, click **Edit Page**.     The Detail Block contains a content type formatter. When editing or viewing the page, it is     looking for a URL to be passed to determine the record to display, which is why it says "Detail     record could not be located". 

**8.** Click the pencil icon to edit and view the Detailed Content block. 

© 2025 ServiceNow, Inc. All rights reserved. ServiceNow, the ServiceNow logo, Now, and other ServiceNow marks are trademarks and/or registered trademarks of ServiceNow, Inc., in the United States and/or other countries. 633 


 The Type drop down list has "Show the page's current document" selected, which indicates that the document_id must be passed to this block from the CMS pages, then it can display the record based on the content type listed in the document_id. 

**9.** From the Common Answers block, on the Self Service page, select a record.     The page opens with a URL similar to: https://<intance     name>.service-now.com/ess/knowledge.do?     sysparm_document_key=kb_knowledge,02255450d731310013ab49547e61038e 

 The table sysparm_document_key=kb_knowledge and sys_id 02255450d731310013ab49547e61038e determine the record. The associated content type, kb_knowledge, renders the content on the Default Detail Page, Portal Knowledge Detail / url_suffix=knowledge. 

 Content blocks 

 A block is a defined piece of content within the system that can be reused. 

 A content page is constructed by arranging customized blocks of content on a page. Content blocks are an important part of a CMS site. Existing content such as reports, gauges, and record lists are automatically available as content blocks and more can be created within the CMS. 

 After defining content blocks, use them on any content page by adding them to drop zones. For more information, see Add content to a page. 

 Create content blocks after sites and pages have been designed.

 Super Menu for Headers 

 The super menu is a hybrid between the drop-down menu and the tabbed system. The user can use a super menu to create a menu from any number of menus. 

 DropDown Menu for Headers 

 The drop-down menu renders the menu sections as drop-down list. Use the mouse to point to the menu name and view the menu items.

 Menu style customization 

 You can customize menu styles in the style sheets your site uses. 

 Navigate to Content Management > Design > Style Sheets to customize style sheets. 

##### Supplementary page navigation menu example code 

 In the following example, look at the CSS class selectors and rules. Also, review how the block containers (div.cms_menu_section_blocks) are defined based on the outer container (TD.layout_content_submenu_column). The outer container is actually a part of the site layout. 

 This concept is clearer if you compare the styles to the styles used in the super menu further down in the example. This example shows that there is no need to make a completely new menu system. You can use CSS to change the look and feel of existing menus.

 Example menu items and content links 

 The method for choosing a link target (current window, iFrame, or new window) and referencing the item linked (page, attachment, or URL) are similar. Review examples of how to link within these elements. 

**-** A content page reference helps you select the desired page. For example, the value home.do     links to the site homepage. 

**-** An attachment reference allows you to reference a single file attached to the menu item or     section record. If there is more than one attachment, only the first attachment is referenced.     The link is then generated automatically and displays a **Browser File Save** prompt. 

**-** The specified URL reference allows you to link to a full URL     string in your instance or from another system. For example,     com.glideapp.servicecatalog_cat_item_view.do?     sysparm_id=66c313e7c0a8016b008ebe1a8e3d97f5&sysparm_nameofstack=b654d15bef92     links to the **Ask a Question** record producer. Use this reference to link to a page in an existing     intranet system. 

 Menu items can be seen as featured links from each section. There are many choices in URL definitions and link options. Links within the ESS Portal open content pages within the site. In turn, each page has an iFrame or set of blocks that houses the corresponding data. This method is useful for rapid prototyping, but consider where to create dynamic detail pages and use the available linking options. 

 Menu item 

 Menu items are similar to content links except they are called by the list block, not as part of a navigation menu block. Menu items and content links function the same as far as how they are defined and the options available for linking to items. Content links are meant to be called

 through a list block that calls the Content Link [content_link] table. Content links do not have the Logged in field or the Roles option used to control the UI experience for various roles.

 Menu sections define groups of links and how the links behave. 

###### Before you begin 

 Role required: content_admin or admin 

###### About this task 

 For example, link behavior determines which page opens when the link is clicked and how it opens, such as in a new page or a new frame. Use the following procedure to view a sample menu section. 

###### Procedure 

**1.** Navigate to **All** > **Content Management** > **Blocks** > **Navigation Menus**. 

**2.** Click **Portal - Block Menu**. 

**3.** In **Menu Sections** related list, click **Order Things**. 

**4.** Click the reference icon next to **Detail Page** to open the page. 

**5.** In **Related Links** , click **Edit Page**.     By default, the link goes to the Order Things page with the Portal - Order Splash Menu (Vertical     Block Menu) in the page content area. 

 In most default CMS menus, the menu section has the menu title with secondary text, a separation line, and the links you define as menu items. Although the design is versatile and flows well between pages, there could be questions about linking and scalability to large catalogs. This practice may only be useful for a small catalog with limited items. 

**6.** To view an example of dynamic content, follow these steps to look at the request catalog list/     grid view on the ESS Portal. 

 a. Add /ess/manage.do to your instance URL. For example, https://<instance name>.service-now.com/ess/manage.do. 

 b. In the Code Example Demos section, click Request Catalog List / Grid View. 

 c. Browse the catalog items.

 Configure dynamic blocks 

 Use dynamic blocks to use scripting or to pull information from the system. Dynamic blocks are where most of your content resides. 

###### Before you begin 

 Role required: content_admin or admin 

###### About this task 

 A good use of dynamic blocks is job postings. Store the postings in knowledge articles and display the postings with a dynamic block. 

 Several dynamic blocks are predefined, including the following items. 

**- New Content** : Each of the new content blocks allows for creating blocks while editing content     pages. 

**- Clean Login** : The default login page requesting user name and password, which includes a     "Remember Me" check box. After the user logs in, this block triggers login rules. 

**- Login** : An area that allows a logged out user to log in and a logged in user to log out. This block     is especially useful on publicly available content pages. 

**- Search** : The global text search field. Currently, global text search is the only form of search that     can be included in a content page. 

**- Search Results** : An area for displaying global text search results. 

 For information about Apache Jelly, see Jelly tags. 

##### Note: Dynamic Content Blocks in Content Management System are not automatically 

 escaped. These blocks must implement their own content escaping (e.g., to protect against potential Cross Site Scripting attacks). For more information, see Jelly escaping types. 

###### Procedure 

**1.** Navigate to **All** > **Content Management** > **Dynamic**. 

**2.** Click **New**. 

**3.** Complete the Dynamic Content form.

 List definitions, similar to content management frames, are decorative containers that control the look and feel of lists. 

###### Before you begin 

 Role required: content_admin or admin 

###### About this task 

 Specifically, list definitions are UI macros that use Apache Jelly script to define how a list is rendered inside a list block. Site design often requires multiple list styles within the layout. Lists are often the primary form of navigation within a site, so it is important to have control over their formatting. 

 Configuring list definitions requires a knowledge of Apache Jelly.

###### Procedure 

**1.** Navigate to **All** > **Content Management** > **Specialty Content** > **iFrames**. 

**2.** Click **New**. 

**3.** Complete the iFrame form fields. 

 iFrame form fields 

 Field Input value 

 Name Type a unique name for the iFrame block. 

 Frame name 

 Type a name for the frame on the page. 

 When you use iFrames to present ServiceNow content such as forms or lists, the frame name must be gsft_main. This name allows links within the iFrame to open within the iFrame. 

 URL Enter the URL to display in the iFrame. If you use the iFrame to display ServiceNow content, start with the page name and do not include the base instance part of the URL. For example, to show the list of requested items, the URL is: 

 sc_req_item_list.do 

 Queries can be applied to the URL. For instance, to display a list of open requested items, the URL is: 

 sc_req_item_list.do?sysparm_query=active=true 

 For more information, see Navigate to a record or module using a URL. 

 Sizing Select an option for iFrame block size. 

##### Note: The Expand to fit content choice only works with ServiceNow content. If 

 Fixed Size is selected, height and width fields are displayed for you to enter the size in pixels. 

##### Note: Some browsers suppress iFrames because they use an X-Frame-Options header 

 value of SAMEORIGIN. The X–Frame-Options header was introduced in Internet Explorer 8 RC1, to help detect and prevent frame-based redressing. The SAMEORIGIN value causes the browser to render a blank page instead of the target page of the <frame> or <iframe> when the frame target is not on the same origin as the page itself. Support for this header has been implemented in Safari 4.0, Chrome 4.1.249.1042, and Firefox 3.6.9 and above.

 Content Management and the Apache Jelly engine 

 Apache Jelly is a Java-based and XML-based scripting and processing engine for turning XML into executable code. 

 The Apache Jelly engine closely resembles XML and should be comfortable for developers familiar with JavaScript, XML, XHTML, or HTML. In the ServiceNow instance, the Apache Jelly engine renders items such as forms, lists, and UI Pages. Apache Jelly code renders well within a dynamic content block, but can have issues when used in static blocks. You can use Jelly tags, calls, and statements, but HTML acts just like XHTML. 

 <?xml version= "1.0" encoding= "utf-8" ?> <j:jelly trim = "false" xmlns:j = "jelly:core" xmlns:g = "glide" xmlns:j2 = "null" xmlns:g2 = "null" > 

 <j:if test = "${current_page.getName()=='Solutions'}" > <h1 class = "page_name" > <b> <a href = "solutions.do?" title = "${gs.getMessage('Solutions')}" >${gs.getMessage('Solutions')}</a> </b> </h1> <p class = "page_description" > ${current_page.getDescription()} </p> <br /> </j:if> <j:if test = "${current_page.getName()=='IT 3.0'}" > <h1 class = "page_name" > <b> <a href = "solutions.do?" title = "${gs.getMessage('Solutions')}" >${gs.getMessage('Solutions')}</a> </b> | ${current_page.getName()}</h1> <p class = "page_description" > ${current_page.getDescription()} </p> <br /> </j:if> </j:jelly> 

 Ensure that all tags are closed. If the tag is not a naturally closing tag, then place a forward slash before the end bracket. For example, a <BR /> or an <IMG src="cms.png" />. 

 If you are unfamiliar with Jelly scripting, review these topics:

**-** Jelly tags 

**-** Extensions to Jelly syntax 

**-** Jelly escaping types 

 Include the following tag with all Apache Jelly scripts. 

 <j:jelly trim= "false" xmlns:j= "jelly:core" xmlns:g= "glide" xmlns:j2= "null" xmlns:g2= "null" > 

 The tag looks complex, but keep the following information in mind. 

**-** Apache Jelly script uses multiple namespaces. 

**-** There are two types of prefixes in tags: j and g. The j prefix is used for tags that are natively part     of Apache Jelly. The g prefix is used for tags that the ServiceNow platform created and is using     for platform purposes. 

 The j2 and g2 prefixes are just like j and g, except that they are processed in a second phase. The Apache Jelly script parser runs through each j and g tag respectively. For example: 

 <j:jelly trim="false" xmlns:j="jelly:core" xmlns:g="glide" xmlns:j2="null" xmlns:g2="null"> <j:set var="jvar_phase1" value="Hello" /> <j2:set var="jvar_phase2" value="World" /> ${jvar_phase1} $[jvar_phase2] </j:jelly> 

 In phase 1, the parser runs through all the j and g tags. It then caches the result. Before it runs the second phase, it takes the j and g namespaces and moves the namespaces to the second phase. It looks something like the following code. 

 <j:jelly trim="false" xmlns:j="jelly:core" xmlns:g="glide" xmlns:j2="jelly:core" xmlns:g2="glide"> <j2:set var="jvar_phase2" value="World" /> Hello $[jvar_phase2] </j:jelly> 

 For subsequent calls of this script, only phase 2 is parsed. 

##### Note: If you plan to use phase 2 Jelly tags (g2 and j2) on the Content Type [content_type] 

 or Dynamic Content [content_block_programmatic] tables, select the Two phase option on the content form. 

 Another example is to create a report of all open incidents assigned to each group. For this purpose, you could use a report and save time, but it is a good example for learning Jelly. Start with the Jelly tag: 

 <j:jelly trim= "false" xmlns:j= "jelly:core" xmlns:g= "glide" xmlns:j2= "null" xmlns:g2= "null" > </j:jelly> 

 First, you need a list of open incidents. Use a g2:evaluate tag. The evaluate tag runs the script. Anything inside the tag is parsed like a business rule, so, for example, you can call global business rules, script includes, and gliderecord.

 <j:jelly trim="false" xmlns:j="jelly:core" xmlns:g="glide" xmlns:j2="null" xmlns:g2="null"> <g:evaluate var="jvar_groups" object="true"> var now_GR = new GlideRecord("sys_user_group"); gr.orderBy('name'); gr.query(); gr; </g:evaluate> </j:jelly> 

 This script is in phase 1 because frequent changes to incident assignment groups are not expected. Also notice the var attribute on the evaluate tag. This attribute specifies what variable is set from this block. At the end of the script, there is a gr on a line by itself. That last line is what sets the variable. 

 You can omit the jvar_groups variable, but then all the variables in the evaluate tag become Apache Jelly variables. The object=true specifies that the variable is not a primitive data type. If object=true is omitted, the script would break because jvar_groups would only be able to hold items like integers and strings. 

 After the evaluate tag, loop through these groups and find the incidents for each one. 

 <j:jelly trim="false" xmlns:j="jelly:core" xmlns:g="glide" xmlns:j2="null" xmlns:g2="null"> <g:evaluate var="jvar_groups" object="true"> var now_GR = new GlideRecord("sys_user_group"); gr.orderBy('name'); gr.query(); gr; </g:evaluate> <table> <tr> <th>Name</th> <th>Incidents</th> </tr> <j:while test="${jvar_groups.next()}"> <tr> <td>${HTML:jvar_groups.getValue('name')}</td> <td></td> </tr> </j:while> </table> </j:jelly> 

 You can include normal XML in the Apache Jelly script at any time. Since there is no namespace, the Apache Jelly script does not try to parse the XML tags. Notice the j:while loop. It is a normal while loop and can iterate through a GlideRecord object. Also notice that you output a value with ${HTML:jvar_groups.getValue('name')}. Here are the important elements: 

**-** The outer brackets, ${}, specify the output of the variable and the phase in which the variable     is output: ${} means first phase, $[] means second phase. 

**-** HTML before the expression is for escaping the output. The expression     jvar_groups.getValue('name') is being escaped for HTML. For other types of     escaping, there are JS (Javascript), NS (No Script), and some other options.

 To select only one record and not iterate through many records, the code looks like the following example: 

 <j:jelly trim="false" xmlns:j="jelly:core" xmlns:g="glide" xmlns:j2="null" xmlns:g2="null"> <g:evaluate var="jvar_groups" object="true"> var now_GR = new GlideRecord("sys_user_group"); gr.orderBy('name'); gr.query(); gr; </g:evaluate> <j:if test="${jvar_groups.next()}"> We found ${HTML:jvar_groups.getValue('name')} </j:if> </j:jelly>

 Header Example Code 

 This dynamic content block needs to be active and have the "Two Phase" option clicked. The g:requires tag is including the UI script defined in the system whose name is "servicenow.website.globals". The file extension in the call is .jsdbx and is used only in the call to the UI script, not in the name of the script in the system. For JSDBX, the file being called is a JavaScript(.js) defined within the database (db) that needs to be cached (x). 

 <?xml version= "1.0" encoding= "utf-8" ?><j:jelly trim = "false" xmlns:j = "jelly:core" xmlns:g = "glide" xmlns:j2 = "null" xmlns:g2 = "null" > 

 <g:requires name = "servicenow.website.globals.jsdbx" /> 

 </j:jelly> 

 Page Title and Description Example Code 

 This dynamic content block needs to be active. There are two actions within this code snippet. First is a forward-looking string container that allows site translation, the ${gs.getMessage('Your Text')} string call). The second action pulls in the page title and description, ${current_page.getName()} and ${current_page.getDescription()}. 

 <?xml version= "1.0" encoding= "utf-8" ?><j:jelly trim = "false" xmlns:j = "jelly:core" xmlns:g = "glide" xmlns:j2 = "null" xmlns:g2 = "null" >

 List Block Pulling From Knowledge Articles Example Code 

 This code example contains one of the best tricks in the CMS. Using the type field with draws from a number of defined list definitions to make slight, or very dramatic changes, to list display. Because the UI is open to configuration and innovation, this is a good opportunity to use design skills. Anyone who can use HTML and CSS knows that a basic list can be turned into a float grid or be made inline. The combinations are limited only by what the designer can dream up and code. 

 In the code example, there is a custom logo field (u_logo) added to the Knowledge form. The custom field displays customer logos, partner logos, and award images on the awards page. There are a number of different sections that use this list definition so efficient reuse is taking place. 

**-** div class="cms_knowledge_list customer_success" - Begin by creating an outer     container with a unique class name that can be used as a basis for CSS style     selectors and rules. From the outer container, many of the child elements can be     accessed for theming. 

**-** <g:for_each_record file="${current}" max="${jvar_max_entries}"> - Loop for list     creation that calls the selected table record and the entries set on the list form. 

**-** <a href="knowledge.do?sysparm_document_key=kb_knowledge,     ${current.sys_id}"><img src="${current.u_logo.getDisplayValue()}"     alt="${current.text}" width="110px"/> - Defines linking to the article detail in the     knowledge base. For further reference, look at content types within the site     definition and you will see some similarities. The knowledge.do? portion of     the URL points to the knowledge detail page which (as mentioned above) is     mandatory if you plan to call the knowledge base in your CMS site. The rest of the     URL represents the syntax for calling a knowledge article by its sys_id. Each and     every item housed within the system has a unique sys_id. 

**-** <ttt>${SP}-${SP}${current.author.first_name}${SP}${current.author.last_name}</     tt> - This example is commented out and not used, but it is still interesting in that     it has a jelly call ${SP} and it pulls the knowledge article's author by first and last     name. 

 <?xml version= "1.0" encoding= "utf-8" ?><j:jelly trim = "false" xmlns:j = "jelly:core" xmlns:g = "glide" xmlns:j2 = "null" xmlns:g2 = "null" > 

 <div class = "cms_knowledge_list customer_success" ><g:for_each_record file = "${current}" max = "${jvar_max_entries}" ><br /><table cellspacing = "0" cellpadding = "0" border = "0" class = "background_transparent" ><tr><td class = "cms_knowledge_list_image" ><j:if test = "${current.u_logo.getDisplayValue() != ''}" ><div class = "knowledge_article_logo" ><a href =

 Style in Content Management 

 Content pages can be styled with CSS, just like any HTML website. 

 Three elements control CSS styles: 

**-** Style Sheets are records containing CSS declarations. 

**-** Themes are groups of style sheets that can be invoked together. 

**-** Frames are UI macros that define the outer border of individual content blocks as they appear     on a content page. Frames work by calling on particular definitions in the style sheets.

 Style sheets 

 Styles sheets are standard Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) that define the look and feel of all elements within the interface. 

 Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) can either be internal (stored in the database) or external (hosted on the server), based on organizational needs. To define an internal style sheet, use standard CSS in the style field. Using external CSS allows the Content Management System to use the same CSS as a corporate website or other online resource. 

 Use an external style sheet by defining a URL that points to the .cssx file. If you upload a .cssx file to the platform, you can reference the .cssx file using a URL. 

 Content pages do not reference style sheets directly. To invoke a style sheet, you assign the style sheet to a Theme using the related list on the Theme form.

 Design themes 

 Design themes are the convergence of structure and styling, making them a critical tool for creating a powerful user interface. 

 For a successful project, review the corporate style guide and communicate with the corporate website art team. If the organization has an art or design department that maintains branding, include them in this process. 

 A theme is a collection of one or more style sheets (CSS files) that define a consistent look for a set of pages. In most environments, many pages share a few themes. Use multiple themes within a site to create stylistic differentiators between site areas. You can also use a single theme to create one unified look and feel for the site.

 Doctypes 

 The view_content html page template on which all CMS is based defaults to doctype=html. 

 The code looks like the following HTML source code. 

 <!DOCTYPE HTML> 

 If your CMS site does not render properly, remove the doctype from the 

###### page by setting the following property: glide.html.doctype.pages = 

 chat_desktop,live_feed,live_feed_small,navigator,navpage11,image_browse

###### The following is the default for this property: glide.html.doctype.pages = 

 chat_desktop,live_feed,live_feed_small,navigator,navpage11,image_browse,view_content 

 Setting this doctype offers these benefits for building new sites: 

**-** Incorporating common practice: Use a practice that is becoming widely adopted across the     Internet and can prevent certain browsers from running in quirks mode. 

**-** Cleaner CSS and markup: Write more standards-based CSS and markup to promote code     sharing. 

**-** A step towards browser compatibility: Find solutions that work across browsers and avoid     browser-specific workarounds. 

 Format a frame 

 Frames provide a way to manage decorative containers for content blocks and any other elements within the site. For example, one frame can be a container, made of div or span tags, that is styled with rounded corners.

 Content Management meta tags 

 Meta tags are special tags in web pages that contain information about the page but are not rendered with the page. You can define custom meta tags for content pages. 

 Meta tags are not noticeable to a page visitor unless the visitor looks at the page source code. Web search engines read meta tags as they "crawl" the web, identifying and organizing content. Modern website designers often use meta tags to embed "hints" to search engines about how to index or otherwise crawl the site. 

 Structurally, a meta tag consists of a tag and a name/content pair and looks similar to the following code. 

 <meta name="generator" content="MediaWiki 1.16wmf4" /> 

 The Content Management System allows you to define both site level and page level tags. 

 Configure a page level meta tag 

 A page level tag is a meta tag defined on a specific page and included on only that page.

 Configure DIV-based layouts 

 After you create your site, you can change the site layout with DIV tags. 

###### Before you begin 

 Role required: content_admin or admin 

###### About this task 

 Many web page layouts use tables for a consistent look and feel. Tables are effective for numbers and statistics, but can be limiting for designing other types of information. DIV tags are flexible block-element tags. To use DIV tags for layouts, give the tag an ID and assign attributes using CSS. 

 Changing to CSS and DIV tags help in the following ways: 

**-** simplify code 

**-** reduce the amount of code 

**-** increase page load speed 

**-** separate content from presentation 

**-** help pages adapt to different device resolutions 

**-** make pages easier for search engines to crawl 

**-** make code more compliant with evolving web page design standards

 A theme named Administration Theme Charcoal is included as an example of CSS-driven, DIV-based layouts. To view the Administration Theme Charcoal DIV-based layout, complete the following steps. 

###### Procedure 

**1.** Navigate to **All** > **Content Management** > **Design** > **Layouts**. 

**2.** Click **Admin 1 Column** 

**3.** Review the code. 

 Content meta tag hierarchy 

 Page and site level meta tags are included in a content meta tag hierarchy. 

##### Site and page level tags 

 CMS supports page level and site level tags. The system behavior is to show the sum of all page level and site level tags. For example, if you have two tags on the site and one tag on the page, all with different names, you see three tags on the page. Two are from the site and one is from the page. If both the site and the page have a tag of the same name, only the page tag is used. 

##### Note: The Content Management System does not support some commonly used meta 

 tags. For example, you cannot use the X-UA-Compatible meta tag, which allows you to specify which version of Internet Explorer a site should be rendered in. 

##### Example: all tags have unique names 

 Site Level Name Content breakfast eggs lunch sandwich 

 Page Level Name Content dinner steak 

 Output Name Content breakfast eggs lunch sandwich dinner steak 

##### Example: page level tag overrides site level tag 

 Site Level Name Content breakfast eggs lunch sandwich 

 Page Level Name Content lunch tacos <--overrides site level dinner steak 

 Output Name Content breakfast eggs

##### Content Management integration points 

 Integration points use content blocks in CMS to link different applications together using static and dynamic methods. 

 By using integration points, users can connect to different systems from a single page. The power of the CMS is that it can display any data within the ServiceNow platform. The ESS portal, for example, connects users to a service catalog, a knowledge base, and a help and incident reporting site. Each section contains a set of links to additional content. List blocks offer the easiest way to display data dynamically. Content types define how lists link to the detailed data they reference. 

 Generating lists from the ServiceNow platform is straightforward, especially if you use filtering. When the CMS was first introduced, lists were the only method available to create navigational systems for sites. Content types define system record links using specific templates to define the list and the details. 

**-** Summary template: defines the list 

**-** Detail template: defines the detail as it is rendered in a page. 

 The templates work together to pass data attributes or Unique record identifier (sys_id) (sysid) into a single detail page that manages the data. Any attribute variations use the URL sent to the page. 

 Understanding how content types work can mean the difference between a site with 20 pages versus a site with 200 pages. There is a time for both types of data calls. Depending on the task, there are appropriate times to use static content and times for dynamic methods. 

 View links between system elements and URLs 

 You can view the links between your system elements and their URLs to render more specific content within your site. 

###### Before you begin 

 Role required: content_admin or admin 

###### About this task 

 See the Navigate to a record or module using a URL page for an overview of URL syntax in the ServiceNow platform. 

 The Incidents list offers a quick example of viewing a form within its own tab. This viewing method illustrates how to append the URL string to render more specific content within your site. 

###### Procedure 

**1.** Navigate to **Incident** > **All**. 

**2.** Right-click in a blank area within the content frame and select **Open Frame in New Window** or     **Open Frame in New Tab**.     The URL returned looks similar to this example. 

 <instance_name>/incident_list.do? sysparm_userpref_module=b55b4ab0c0a80009007a9c0f03fb4da9 

 The URL is comprised of the following elements.

 ◦ incident_list.do? is the call to the list with no parameters passed into it. Explore context menu options and list filtering variations to see how the URL string is appended with each action. 

 ◦ incident_list.do?sysparm_query=&sysparm_view=ess is an example of how the view is passed in the URL string. 

 ◦ incident_list.do?sysparm_query=GROUPBYactive&sysparm_view= is how the URL looks when the group by option is chosen from the context menu. 

 ◦ incident_list.do?sysparm_query=category%3Dsoftware is the result of applying a category is software filter to the list. 

 Explore all the options available within the right-click menu. Click through to the Incident form itself (incident.do) to see what the URL string does when parameters are passed into it. 

 Element link examples 

 View examples that show how to create a site pointing to various system data in several different data tables. 

 The following examples illustrate setting up access to the following system data. 

**-** Knowledge: building a versatile front end for a knowledge base, from overview page to     variations on the list definitions used in the site. 

**-** Catalog: ideas for a business-to-consumer shopping experience that pulls various items and     forms from your service catalog. 

**-** Service Portfolio: using the business service portfolio to contain all defined services offered by     your organization. 

**-** Featured reports: methods for linking to the most important reports.

 Page source view 

 Use the tools available in your browser to view the frame source page and understand what URL address bars pass between system frame sets. 

 The Firefox browser, for example, has the developer tools option. This option provides an easy way to view records that render within the main content frame (gsft_main) of the ServiceNow platform. Also, Firefox quickly builds menus and links to records within the system. 

 This Firefox functionality is useful when stepping through the menu items section.

 Static methods 

 Static methods in the CMS application were created for ease of use. 

 Form-based menu management and WYSYWIG code editing can be useful to both advanced and entry-level users. The technical ability of subject matter experts (SMEs) managing the language of your site can vary considerably. Letting SMEs write the content and having a technical resource manage the linking expedites menu and link creation within the system.

 Static and dynamic methods 

 Navigation Menu Links 

 Use base system templates to group similar links for placement on the page. Though the terminology is different (menu sections and menu items), this type of linking behaves the same way as content links. For more information on creating a navigation menu block, see Create a navigation menu block. 

 Static HTML Details 

 Content blocks that are useful for areas administered by developers unfamiliar with HTML or markup. Anyone familiar with markup can use dynamic blocks because they are extendable. For more information on static HTML, see Using Content Blocks. 

 Content Links 

 The predecessors to navigation menus from when the CMS was first introduced. Use content links to make navigational links by defining several content links under the same category. Then, call the links as a list referencing the Content Link [content_link] table. 

 iFrame Details 

 Used both dynamically and statically throughout the system. Using them is an easy way to bring any form or list into your CMS pages. For more information on iFrame methods, see Using Content Blocks. 

 Dynamic methods 

 While static methods are a powerful navigational tool, you have more control over data rendering using the dynamic methods. 

 Reference common code in the system to make long-term maintenance of the site easier. Coding skills are useful when implementing dynamic methods.

 Static and dynamic methods 

 Dynamic Blocks 

 These blocks are where the majority of your work resides. For more information, see Configure dynamic blocks. 

 Frames 

 Frames are meant to be decorative wrappers around any block in the system. They are mentioned with dynamic blocks because frames are essentially UI macros with the category of Frame. Frames apply the ${body} variable to a block and define where the block is inserted when rendered on the page. 

 Lists 

 Lists generate links to records based on the filtering rules you define. Lists can be sorted for presentation by any field in the corresponding record. Lists help supplement navigation and pull data from outside the CMS. For more information, see Customize the list block. 

 Content Types 

 Content types provide site-specific control of how system data defined as templates is rendered. The rendering of lists is considered first (summary templates). The next consideration is the detail template, which allows control over the record rendering. 

 List Definitions 

 List definitions enable you to extend the summary template defaults defined on the site level. Used with frames, list definitions render the same data differently based on the placement on the page or site. For more information, see Configure list definitions. 

 Detailed Content 

 Detailed content in page detail settings) are blocks that display the content of an existing document as a block on a content page. For more information, see Configure a detailed content block.

 Business Services links to a content page (CMS page referenced: Business Service Portfolio, URL: (business_service_category.do) that pulls the system service catalog homepage into a frame within the content area. Each link within this section uses the browse by category page, where you pass in the name of the category to return results. 

**-** Target page iFrame URL: catalog_home.do?     sysparm_nameofstack=aabdae07ef221000914304167b22567d&sysparm_view=business&s

 Reporting links to a content page that pulls the reports page into an iFrame. All links within this menu leverage homepages in the system, which creates an issue with the home.do URL. Notice in the following links that ../ is used to create a relative URL outside of the CMS site home.do definition. Without this path, the site homepage would render within the iFrame.

##### Content Management testing 

 Test your site to ensure that all pages display correctly, links go to the specified address, and images are not broken. It is important to test the site as you build it. Do not wait until just before launch to begin testing. 

 Also, test templates as you create them so any issues are resolved before creating other content based on the templates. Recruit as many people as possible to help you test. 

 Here are some general site testing guidelines: 

**-** Test on the browsers and platforms your site visitors use 

**-** Test on various monitors (for example, LCD and CRT) 

**-** View pages using different screen resolutions 

**-** View pages using different color settings 

**-** Test all navigation and links 

**-** Test items that can be downloaded (for example, PDF files) 

**-** Test the search functionality 

**-** Test site security 

**-** If necessary, test for accessibility (for guidelines, see the W3C Website Accessibility     Initiative ) 

##### Global search in Content Management 

 When you add global search to a CMS site, two different search result blocks can display, depending on the user role: global or no global. 

© 2025 ServiceNow, Inc. All rights reserved. ServiceNow, the ServiceNow logo, Now, and other ServiceNow marks are trademarks and/or registered trademarks of ServiceNow, Inc., in the United States and/or other countries. 678 


 Roles are defined at System Properties > Global Text Search. 

**-** Search Results (Global): For users with permission to use the global search within the normal     frame set. The normal frame set is defined as the default, non-CMS user interface with the set     of frames. 

**-** Search Results (No Global): For users without permission to use the global search. Searches     only the knowledge base and the catalog. 

 The header search bar and the Search dynamic block in the base system both automatically handle the permissions and direct the user to the appropriate search results. In the base system, the search result blocks are deployed on the same Search Results content page. 

 In order for the global search to work properly, it is important to ensure that the DEFAULT directs users to a working content page. If not, the results from the global search link back to the frame set, not to pages within the CMS site. 

##### Note: The global search is similar to the normal frame set user interface and ties to the 

 same roles (Set global text search properties ). 

##### Search Results (Global) 

 Before you use the Search Results (Global) dynamic block, define Configure content types to control the behavior a search result is clicked. If no content type is defined for a table, selecting a link on that table renders the results according to the DEFAULT content type. It is good practice to point the DEFAULT content type to a page with a normal "Current Document" detailed block. Set the content type detail ( Detail Template field) to have just an iFrame. 

 The Search Results (No Global) dynamic block does not require any additional configuration. 

##### CMS translation 

 You can translate CMS sites by activating internationalization plugins and manually translating custom interface strings. 

 Two tables support the translation of a CMS site into other languages. 

**-** Translated Name / Field [sys_translated]: Stores strings that are shared or commonly used     within a site. These include menu section names, menu item names, site breadcrumb names,     link names, and footer menu links. Internationalization plugins typically provide translations for     these strings. SeeSystem Localization. 

**-** Translated Text [sys_translated_text]: Stores unique string translations which you create when     you manually translate interface elements. See Export and edit translation records. 

 View a translated CMS site 

 Activate an internationalization plugin, which provides a quick way to see translated strings for CMS menus, breadcrumbs, and links. For a full translation, you must translate the instance manually.

 Understanding Service Portal 

 Service Portal provides a modular user interface framework for quick and easy building of application portals and dashboards for the platform. It helps developers and non‑technical administrators create attractive and engaging user experiences that drive employee adoption of critical enterprise applications. 

##### How to use Service Portal 

 Service Portal is an application included in the platform UI, however it includes a visual layer for you to do most of your configuration. In the application navigator, navigate to Service Portal > Service Portal Configuration to view the configuration page. 

 The Service Portal configuration page provides a unique, intuitive way of viewing all the pieces of your portal and how they interact with one another. The configuration page allows you to take advantage of a real-time preview, while configuring portal settings. Use each of the tiles on the configuration homepage to assemble the different components of your portal. 

 If you prefer the platform layout for configuring Service Portal, you still have the option of creating your portal components within the platform UI. The two options are not separate. Everything you create in the Service Portal configuration page also appears in a table in the platform UI. 

##### Who can use Service Portal 

 Several different kinds of users can configure a portal. 

**-** Limited coding: Service Portal was designed so that even users with limited coding ability or     knowledge of the platform UI could set up a portal. 

**-** ServiceNow Experts: Users with an understanding of the ServiceNow platform can create     portals, set up URL redirects, and view all the components of the portal in a table. Most     portal configuration takes place in the Service Portal configuration page, but in specific     circumstances, Service Portal administrators may need to do additional configuration directly     within the platform. 

**-** Developers: Advanced customizations and new widget creation are tasks for a developer or     someone who understands AngularJS and Twitter bootstrap. 

 In all cases, the user configuring a portal must have the admin or sp_admin role. 

##### Basic concepts 

 You should have a basic understanding of all the following components that make up a portal: 

**-** Themes: Themes define the look and feel of the whole portal, but can be overridden by other     style configurations. 

**-** Pages: Pages control where and how you store portal content. Pages do not have a defined     relationship to portal records, they simply exist. 

© 2025 ServiceNow, Inc. All rights reserved. ServiceNow, the ServiceNow logo, Now, and other ServiceNow marks are trademarks and/or registered trademarks of ServiceNow, Inc., in the United States and/or other countries. 682 


**-** Widgets: Components in Service Portal are called widgets. You can use HTML templates, CSS,     client scripts, server scripts, and any JavaScript dependencies to define what a widget does.     From an AngularJS standpoint, widgets are essentially a superset of an Angular directive. 

**-** Most of the data in Service Portal is managed in different locations throughout the system. 

 For example, if you are building a knowledge portal, the data exists in Service Portal, but the knowledge articles are authored and managed in the Knowledge application. The same is true for any other type of content you plan to leverage. Take time to understand which tables contain and control the data you are working with in Service Portal. 

##### Before you begin 

 Take the following into consideration before configuring Service Portal: 

**-** Who are you building your site for and why? 

**-** What information do you want to include in your site? 

**-** What do you want the mobile experience to be for users? 

**-** Which platform applications do you plan to use in your portal? 

 You can use parts of the platform, such as knowledge articles and catalog items, as the content for your portal. 

 For example, if you are building a knowledge portal, the content displays in Service Portal, but the knowledge articles are authored and managed in the Knowledge application. The same is true for any other type of content you plan to leverage. It is important to take time to understand the table structure of data to become acquainted with content. 

**-** How customized is your service catalog? Catalog client scripts and UI policies only work in     Service Portal if they use the mobile GlideForm API , so you may need to make some changes. 

##### Additional resources 

 Service Portal is built using several well known technologies. Use the following websites as resources to help you understand and configure your portal: 

**-** Twitter Bootstrap 

**-** CSS 3 Flexbox 

**-** AngularJS 

 Service Portal core concepts 

 Service Portal contains two parts: a framework and a portal. The framework is composed of a set of APIs, Angular services, directives, and tools that help to build portals. The portal is a group of pages linked by page IDs.

 Service Portal overview diagram 

 After you enter a URL, the framework uses the suffix and picks the appropriate portal to determine the theme and configurations. Then it loads the configured default portal homepage unless the URL has a specified ID. 

 Each widget added to a page becomes its own instance. A widget instance is basically the application of a widget in a page. Because widgets are reusable and can appear on different pages to do different things, the manifestation of a widget on a page is referred to as a Widget Instance. The page loads with content represented by widgets. 

 Widget instances get their logic from the base widget template, client scripts, server scripts, and depending on the widget, CSS. 

 Service Portal configuration page 

 Most Service Portal configuration is accessible through the Service Portal configuration page landing page. 

 In your instance, access the Service Portal configuration page by navigating to Service Portal > Service Portal configuration. The Service Portal configuration page opens in a new tab in your browser.

 Service Portal configuration page 

 You can also access the configuration page by appending your URL with sp_config. For example, https://<instance name>.service-now.com/sp_config. 

 Use each option on the Service Portal config page to set up the different parts of your portal. 

 Page navigation in Service Portal by URL 

 You can navigate to a portal or a page in Service Portal using a URL. 

 Service Portal URLs have the following structure: 

 https://<instance>/<portal suffix>/<guest language>/<keywords>?id=<page id>&lang=<language>&<page parameters> 

 Element Description 

 instance Unique, secure web address for each instance. The default format is https://<instance name>.service-now.com. 

 portal suffix Suffix established for the portal. For example, /sp. 

 guest language The language ID of the portal language. For example, es for Spanish. The page returns in the language specified if the language is active and the user accessing the page is a guest user. 

 keywords Human readable keywords that improve search engine optimization (SEO) and click-through rates for public pages. Human readable URLs also help users understand what to expect on a page for public and non-public pages. For example, https:// <instance>/kb/en/faq/what-is-a-cookie? id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0000007. 

 For more information, see Add human readable keywords to page URLs.

 is active and the user accessing the page is a guest user or an authenticated user without a language preference set. 

 page parameters Additional parameters are required by some pages to load dynamic content by looking up a record (table, sys_id). Find the $sp.getParameter calls in a widget server script to see the parameters that a widget uses. For more detail on this method, see GlideSPScriptable Scoped. 

 If you don’t include these additional parameters when required, you might get a You are either not authorized or record is not valid error message. 

 For example, the URL for a public knowledge base page in Spanish in Service Portal could be https://<instance>/sp/es/faq/what-is-a-cookie? id=kb_article&sys_id=KB0000007. 

##### Note: If you use article versioning with the Knowledge Management Service Portal 

 (com.snc.knowledge_serviceportal) plugin, you must add the article version number to the URL to open a knowledge article in the base system or knowledge portals. For example, instead of accessing an article using the URL https://<instance>/sp? id=kb_article&sys_id=KB0000005, you must include the article version number: https://<instance>/sp?id=kb_article&sys_id=KB0000005%20V1.0. To learn more, see Article versioning. 

##### Referencing a page ID 

 Widgets and widget instance options reference Service Portal pages using the page ID. For example, a link to the sc_home page within a widget HTML template might appear as follows: 

 <div><a href="?id=sc_home">${Order something...}</a></div> 

 Content Management and Service Portal 

 Service Portal is a compelling alternative to the Content Management System (CMS) with a refined user experience. It does not duplicate CMS or platform UI functionality. Users who have sophisticated experiences delivered through CMS may need to invest time into transitioning to Service Portal, especially if the CMS implementation includes complex and customized Service Catalog forms. 

##### Service Portal compatibility with existing CMS sites 

 ServiceNow continues to support CMS in current and upcoming releases. If you have existing CMS sites and activate Service Portal on your instance, your CMS sites will continue to work, as CMS and Service Portal are separate applications. 

##### Differences between Service Portal and CMS 

 Service Portal is an alternative to CMS based on more modern technologies. Major differences include: 

 Underlying technology 

 CMS uses Jelly, which is not a widely used technology. Service Portal instead uses AngularJS , server-side JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Any scripts that use Jelly do

 not work in Service Portal. Building widgets in Service Portal requires knowledge of AngularJS. 

 Visual layer 

 CMS uses iFrames which can be difficult to work with, limited in terms of styling, and susceptible to upgrade issues. Alternatively, Service Portal is a self-contained application that accesses data from other tables on the platform. This enables finetuned control over style and responsive design. 

 Mobile first 

 Unlike CMS, Service Portal is optimized for a mobile environment. For this reason, the following apply to the Service Portal environment: 

**-** Any scripts used in Service Portal can only use APIs supported in a mobile     environment. For example, some APIs used in your Service Catalog client scripts     may not be supported. For a list of supported APIs, see Service Portal and client     scripts. 

**-** Service Portal forms support a maximum of two-columns. As a result, any highly     customized Service Catalog forms, such as catalog items and record producers     that use containers and variable sets, must be simplified to work in a two-column     layout. 

 If transitioning to Service Portal, review the following resource: Mobile client GlideForm (g form) scripting and migration. 

 To understand how core CMS components are configured in Service Portal, refer to the following table. 

 CMS and Service Portal components 

**CMS component** (^) **Service Portal equivalent** Content site Portal Content page Page Content types Content types link a table to a content page. In Service Portal, content types are no longer required. Record data is queried and displayed using base system widgets. You can add widgets to any number of Service Portal pages. Learn more: Using portal widgets. Layout and dropzones In Service Portal, pages are made up of containers, rows, and columns. Learn more: Pages. Content block A content block is a reusable piece of content. In Service Portal, content blocks are replaced by widgets. Learn more: Using portal widgets. © 2025 ServiceNow, Inc. All rights reserved.

 CMS and Service Portal components (continued) 

**CMS component** (^) **Service Portal equivalent** Service Catalog Service Catalog pages are rendered using the SC Catalog Item widget in Service Portal. For this reason, Service Catalog forms such as catalog items and record producers are shared between your CMS implementation and Service Portal. If you have a highly customized Service Catalog, you may need to invest time in simplifying your Service Catalog items and client scripts so that they render as expected in Service Portal. Learn more: Service Catalog forms in Service Portal. Theme Theme CSS CSS 

##### CMS and Service Catalog customizations 

 Service Portal comes with base system widgets to address common use cases and to display record data. Even though there is no direct migration path from CMS to Service Portal, there may be some items, such as catalog items or knowledge articles, that render as expected in Service Portal without any effort. 

 However, because Service Portal is supported in a mobile environment, you may need to modify any customized forms and scripts. This approach ensures that the items display well on a mobile device and present a better user experience. Before transitioning to Service Portal, you may need to: 

**-** Refactor client scripts used in your CMS/Service Catalog to use supported mobile APIs and     global objects. For a list of supported APIs, see Service Portal and client scripts. 

**-** Build widgets to replace UI Macros and other unsupported scripts. If using a UI Macro in a     catalog item form and referencing values on the form, you can use the following workaround     instead: Replace a Service Catalog form script with a widget. 

**-** Simplify any complex forms used in your Service Catalog to fit the Service Portal two-column     form layout. 

**-** Consider which release supports the required functionality. You may want to upgrade your     instance before transitioning to ensure that you have the required base system features. 

 CMS to Service Portal transition 

 Your CMS may include complex forms and customizations that do not render as expected in Service Portal. Use this guide to understand how best to modify your CMS and Service Catalog implementation for Service Portal adoption, and to understand how a conversion may affect your users. 

 If you are considering transitioning from CMS to Service Portal, make sure that you understand the impact of moving to a mobile environment. Review the Mobile client GlideForm (g form) scripting and migration.

##### Support level and transition actions 

 CMS component Service Portal^ support^ 

 Possible transition actions 

 Data lookups The client-side component of a data lookup is not supported in Service Portal. However, the data lookup is applied in the platform when a record is submitted or updated in Service Portal. 

 While data lookups are not applied in the Service Portal, the record updates as expected in the platform UI when submitted or updated in the Service Portal. If your CMS is used by requesters only, this limitation may not affect your implementation. 

 Content blocks Because Content blocks use Jelly, they are not supported in Service Portal 

 . 

 In the Service Portal, content blocks are replaced by widgets. Widgets are highly customizable components that can query record data, display and update records, and gather user input. 

 Base system widgets generally cover most use cases. Just as you add content blocks to a page in your CMS, you can add widgets to a page using the Service Portal Designer. 

 UI Macros Because UI Macros use Jelly, they are not supported in Service Portal. 

**-** In Service Portal, you can use     widgets instead of UI Macros. Base     system widgets generally cover most     use cases, but for custom solutions,     you can develop new widgets using     AngularJS. 

**-** If your implementation includes UI     Macros in Service Catalog forms that     reference other fields or variables in     the form, you can embed the widget     inside a Service Catalog variable.     Learn more: Replace a Service     Catalog form script with a widget. 

 UI actions All server-side UI actions are supported in Service Portal, although 

###### setRedirectURL() operations are 

 ignored because Service Portal forms handle redirection in a different way than the platform. 

 The form widget ignores all UI actions marked as Client. 

**-** Refactor any UI actions to remove 

###### setRedirectURL() operations. 

**-** Check that UI actions are not marked     as client.

 CMS component Service Portal^ support^ 

 Possible transition actions 

 Catalog client scripts 

 Only UI Type options Mobile / Service Portal and All are supported. UI type Desktop is not supported in Service Portal. For a list of supported APIs, see Service Portal and client scripts. 

##### Note: Synchronous JavaScript 

 calls are not supported in Service Portal and must be replaced by asynchronous calls. For example, 

###### the getXMLWait() method 

 of the GlideAjax class is not supported in Service Portal. Instead, use one of the following supported asynchronous methods: 

**-** getXML(Function 

###### callback) 

**-** getXMLAnswer(Function 

###### callback) 

 For additional information on GlideAjax, refer to GlideAjax. 

 To understand the impact of updating your CMS to work in a mobile environment, review Mobile client GlideForm (g form) scripting and migration. 

**-** Update your scripts to remove any     unsupported client APIs. 

**-** Check that the script UI Type is set to     **Mobile / Service Portal** or **All**. 

 UI policies Scripted UI policies can only use APIs supported in Service Portal. For a list of supported APIs, see Service Portal and client scripts. 

 Update your scripts to remove any unsupported client APIs. 

 Service Catalog variables 

 Service Catalog variables are supported in Service Portal with the following exceptions: 

**-** UI Macros and UI pages variable     types are not supported. 

**-** Validation Scripts for variables are     not supported. Supported validation     types include: 

**-** If embedding a widget in a catalog     item form, you can use the UI Macro     variable type. Learn more: Replace     a Service Catalog form script with a     widget. 

**-** If using variable with annotations,     make sure to test your catalog items     in Service Portal to ensure that help     text displays as expected.

 CMS component Service Portal^ support^ 

 Possible transition actions 

 ◦ The Mandatory field on the variable form. 

 ◦ Read-only variables. 

 ◦ All fields in the Availability tab of the variable form. 

**-** Default variable size is not supported. 

**-** Expanding and collapsing help text is     not supported. Rather, the **Help text**     and **Instructions** fields defined in the     Annotations tab on the variable form     are always expanded. The **Help tag**     does not display. 

**-** The List Collector variable displays as     a choice list instead of a slushbucket     in the Service Portal. 

 Order guides Order Guides in^ Service Portal^ use the Order Guide widget. 

 Large order guides can cause performance issues in the Service Portal. If you have large order guides, you can: 

**-** Break them into multiple order     guides. 

**-** Simplify variables used in the order     guides. 

**-** As a temporary solution, you can     render the Service Catalog item using     an iFrame. See Service Catalog forms     in Service Portal. 

 Record producers Record producers are used in^ Service Portal with the following differences: 

**-** The sort order for catalog items in     record producers is not honored. 

**-** Date values do not honor time zone     when the record producer submits a     record. 

 Make sure to test all record producers used in Service Portal to make sure that they behave as expected. 

 Login scenarios and redirects 

 In CMS, you used the CMSEntryPage script include to define login scenarios. Instead, Service Portal uses the SPEntryPage script include and related system properties to define login scenarios. Redirects are not supported in Service Portal. 

 In Service Portal, define login behavior by modifying the SPEntryPage script include and setting system properties. 

 For more information, see Single signon, logins, and URL redirects.

 Possible transition actions 

 Service Catalog forms 

 Service Catalog forms such as catalog items and record producers are rendered within widgets in a twocolumn layout. Complex forms may not display as expected. 

**-** Only the top-level container settings     are honored. If there are other     containers within the top-level     container, they are rendered as a     single column. If there are container     splits or nested containers within     these additional containers, they are     rendered as a single column. A top-     level container is not a child of any     other container. 

**-** There can be a maximum of two     columns in Service Portal. If your     implementation includes forms with     more than two columns, the fields     are reorganized into two-columns in     Service Portal. 

**-** Variable sets are treated as     containers. All previously listed rules     apply to variable sets as well as any     containers within them. 

**-** Default variable size is not supported     in Service Portal. 

**-** Simplify any complex forms in your     Service Catalog. 

**-** As a temporary solution, you can     render the Service Catalog item using     an iFrame. See Service Catalog forms     in Service Portal. 

 Shopping cart The^ Service Portal^ includes a base system Shopping Cart widget. 

 Use the Shopping Cart widget. 

 Supported features in Service Portal 

 Service Portal is an alternative presentation layer for the platform. As such, not all features of the platform are extended to Service Portal. Consider your full application and the abilities of Service Portal before making considerable investments. 

##### Not currently supported 

 Domain separation at Levels 1-3. However, Service Portal does include support for domain separation at the Data only level. For more information, see Application support for domain separation and Domain separation and Service Portal.

 Service Catalog forms in Service Portal 

 Service Catalog forms are rendered within Service Portal widgets in a two-column layout. Complex forms may not display as expected. 

##### Recommendations when creating Service Catalog forms 

 Use the following recommendations as a guide to building scalable forms that can be used in both applications: 

**-** Keep forms simple. Because forms with multiple containers, variable sets, and client scripts do     not always display as expected in Service Portal, keep forms short to eliminate conversion and     debugging issues. 

**-** Think in mobile. Any support for Catalog Client Scripts or Catalog UI Policies is the same     as in mobile. Review the following resource: Mobile client GlideForm (g form) scripting and 

 migration. 

##### Form rendering in Service Portal 

 Containers and variable sets within Service Catalog forms are translated into a two-column layout when implemented in Service Portal. Service Catalog forms are rendered in Service Portal using the following rules: 

**-** Only the top-level container settings are honored. If there are other containers within the top-     level container, they are rendered as a single column. If there are container splits or nested     containers within these additional containers, they are rendered as a single column. A top-     level container is not a child of any other container. 

**-** There can be a maximum of two columns in Service Portal. If your implementation includes     forms with more than two columns, the fields are reorganized into two-columns in Service     Portal. 

**-** Variable sets are treated as containers. All previously listed rules apply to variable sets as well     as any containers within them. 

**-** Default variable size is not supported in Service Portal. 

 For other forms in the platform, the view determines how the form displays in Service Portal. For base system tables, the form opens in the Service Portal using the Service Portal Table form views. 

##### Example layout conversions 

 The following examples demonstrate how Service Catalog forms display in Service Portal. 

 Single-column form

 A Service Catalog form with: 

**-** A container with a two-column layout. 

**-** A subcontainer with a single-column layout. 

**-** A subcontainer with a two-column layout. 

 Service Catalog form 

 In Service Portal, the two-column layout setting of the subcontainer is ignored. The subcontainer renders as a single column.

##### Render a complex form in Service Portal using an iFrame 

 Because complex forms do not display as expected in Service Portal, you can render catalog items, record producers, and order guides in Service Portal using an iFrame. This workaround is a temporary solution to enable your Service Portal to function as expected while you simplify any complex Service Catalog forms. 

 When rendering items in an iFrame in Service Portal, the following limitations apply: 

**-** On catalog items and record producers, the attachment icon is not visible. As a result, users     cannot attach any files during the submission. As a workaround, you can add the attachment     button to your form. 

**-** Click-through for the hover-over icon is not available. 

**-** Forms are not optimized for a mobile environment. 

 For more information, see the Service Catalog on Service Portal post in the ServiceNow Community. 

##### Note: Be sure to make changes in a test environment before updating your production 

 instance.

 Service Portal and client scripts 

 You can use client scripts and catalog client scripts in the Service Portal if the UI Type is set to Mobile / Service Portal or All. Client scripts and catalog client scripts are used with the Form widget and SC Catalog Item widget, as opposed to a widget client controller. 

 Before flagging a script as Mobile/Service Portal or All , make sure that you are only using the mobile APIs. Setting a client script to Mobile does not ensure that it will work, it simply flags that the script should be attempted by the mobile app or the Service Portal. Many of your existing client scripts can be set to All as long as the API calls are supported by the mobile client scripting environment. 

 The topics in this section require advanced coding knowledge and an understanding of Service Portal APIs. 

##### Checking desktop vs mobile runtime 

 You might want to mark a client script compatible with both desktop and mobile, but include behavior that depends on the runtime. You can use this script: 

 if (window === null) // Write your mobile compatible code here else // Write your desktop compatible code here 

##### Unsupported client scripting globals 

 The following globals and APIs are unavailable in client scripts and catalog client scripts used in the Service Portal: 

**-** $ 

**-** $$ 

**-** $j 

**-** angular 

**-** control 

**-** document 

**-** jQuery 

**-** window 

##### Note: Widget client controllers are full Angular controllers and are not subject to the 

 unsupported client script globals listed here. Use jQuery and Angular as needed. 

##### Embedded widgets & g_form 

 When using the Service Catalog variable type Macro and Macro with Label , you can pick a widget to embed in a catalog item form. Within the client controller for the embedded widget you can access the field object and catalog item g_form instance using: 

**-** $scope.page.field 

**-** $scope.page.g_form()

##### Example: Client scripts used with Service Portal 

###### The g_list global helps you set the filter of a Glide list element or a list collector variable. Use 

 this API in place of the g_filter API on desktop client scripts. 

 function onLoad() { var myListCollector = g_list.get("my_list_collector"); myListCollector.reset(); 

 myListCollector.setQuery("active=true^category=8c7b22230b402200 b0b02c6317673a62"); myListCollector.addItem('3a700d39af5f4fc0aab978df90f4c692', 'Power Supply'); myListCollector.addItem('1cb93419a3a248318da8f814140b42f6', 'Backpack'); } 

###### g_service_catalog is only available in Service Portal service catalog item scripts. Use this 

 API to know if your catalog item script is run as part of an order guide or on its own. 

 function onLoad() { if (window) // if CMS, don't run this return; 

 // g_service_catalog api for Service Portal and Mobile var isOrderGuide = g_service_catalog.isOrderGuide(); g_form.setValue("is_order_guide", isOrderGuide? "Yes!" : "Nope :("); } 

 Supported client script types and APIs 

 Some client scripts are not supported in Service Portal. Others must have a UI type set to All or Mobile / Service Portal. If using a client script in the Service Portal, only client-side APIs supported in a mobile environment can be used. 

##### Client script support in Service Portal 

 Client script 

 Description 

 Catalog client scripts 

 Service Portal requires that the UI Type field be set to All or Mobile / Service Portal. Client Scripts marked as Desktop rely on legacy APIs that are not supported in Service Portal. Before flagging a script as Mobile / Service Portal or All, make sure you are only using supported client-side APIs. 

 Validation scripts Service Portal^ requires that the^ UI Type^ field be set to^ All^ or^ Mobile / Service Portal. Client Scripts marked as Desktop rely on legacy APIs that are not supported in Service Portal. Before flagging a script as Mobile / Service Portal or All, make sure you are only using supported client-side APIs. 

 Validate user input in a specific field type using a validation script. In new instances, Service Portal includes XML, Script, Script (Plain), Email, and Version validation scripts by default. If upgrading from a previous release, the Mobile and Service Portal version is not active by default. You must activate the Mobile and

 Client script 

 Description 

 Service Portal version of the validation script to validate user input in the Service Portal. See Activate Service Portal validation scripts. 

##### Note: To call a UI script within a Validation script, use the g_ui_scripts global 

 object. For more information, see GlideUIScripts. Verify that the UI script has the Global field set to false and UI Type set to Mobile / Service Portal or All. 

 UI scripts Service Portal requires that the UI Type field be set to All or Mobile / Service Portal. Client Scripts marked as Desktop rely on legacy APIs that are not supported in Service Portal. Before flagging a script as Mobile / Service Portal or All, make sure you are only using supported client-side APIs. 

 UI Actions All server-side UI actions are supported in Service Portal, although setRedirectURL() operations are ignored because Service Portal forms handle redirection in a different way than the platform. 

 The form widget ignores any UI Actions marked as Client. 

 UI Policies Supported, although you should use only declarative UI Policies. Avoid scripting unless the outcome cannot be achieved through the condition builder. 

 UI Macros Not supported as UI macros use Jelly. 

 Formatters Not supported as formatters use Jelly. 

##### Supported client-side APIs 

 Supported client scripting APIs for use in onLoad, onChange, and onSubmit client scripts. 

 For detailed class and method information, see the Client API reference.

##### Configuring Service Portal 

 Plan and set up a self-service portal for your employees or customers. 

##### Configuration overview 

 The following list is a high-level overview of the workflow to get started configuring a portal. However, there may be use cases where performing these steps in a different order is preferred. 

**1.** Upgrade Service Portal 

 If you upgraded from a previous release, you might need to perform additional tasks to take advantage of new or updated functionality in Service Portal. 

**2.** Create a new portal or update a base system portal 

 A portal is the engine that houses all the references to content for your site. The portal record defines the URL extension for a site, as well as things like the knowledge base, catalog, and homepage. You can also use the portal record to define the header menu and the portal 

© 2025 ServiceNow, Inc. All rights reserved. ServiceNow, the ServiceNow logo, Now, and other ServiceNow marks are trademarks and/or registered trademarks of ServiceNow, Inc., in the United States and/or other countries. 708 


 branding. You can create a new portal or update an existing base system portal to suit your needs. 

**3.** Configure portal branding 

 With the Branding Editor, you can configure the styles and theme of your portal in a view with real-time updates. You can see how your portal appears to users with the click of a button. More advanced users still have the option of creating CSS style sheets for the portal theme. However, they won't take advantage of the real-time update that the Branding Editor provides. Changes made in the Branding Editor or to specific components of the portal (such as a widget or a page container) override any customizations made to the theme. If you need more customization than what the Branding Editor can provide, see Create a portal theme. 

**4.** Create new pages or update base system pages and configure widgets 

 Pages are the centerpiece of the end-user experience. Page definitions not only control the layout of the content, they craft the experience for the user. Pages also help define mobile responsiveness, which is a key component in the user experience. Use any existing base system pages as an example for your own creation or create new pages from scratch. 

 Widgets are what define the content of your pages. You can use the base system widgets provided with Service Portal to get started configuring pages. 

**5.** Configure search in a portal 

 Search data displays within a widget on the search page. To make data searchable from a portal, create a search source that fetches data from a single table within your instance, from multiple tables, or from an external site. Enable AI Search to take advantage of intelligent query features and quickly find the answers they need. 

**6.** Manage access to a portal 

 Manage who can access your portal by making pages public, configuring user logins and single sign-on, limiting page access by role, or enabling multi-factor authentication. You can also use advanced user criteria for access to pages, widgets, and more. 

##### Example: Common portal configurations 

 Refer to this video for examples of common configurations for portals. Learn about configuring redirection, landing page branding, and language selection in portals. 

 Upgrading Service Portal 

 After upgrading a ServiceNow instance from a previous release, you might need to perform additional tasks to take advantage of new or updated functionality in Service Portal. 

 Refer to the topics in this section for information about changes to implement to use the latest functionality in Service Portal. 

 Activate the Knowledge Article View page on upgrade 

 If upgrading from a previous release, take advantage of the latest article view features by activating the Knowledge Article View page route map. New capabilities include article versioning and using links and images in article feedback. This map is active by default in new instances and applies to all portals in the system. 

###### Before you begin 

 Role required: admin 

© 2025 ServiceNow, Inc. All rights reserved. ServiceNow, the ServiceNow logo, Now, and other ServiceNow marks are trademarks and/or registered trademarks of ServiceNow, Inc., in the United States and/or other countries. 709 


###### About this task 

 The Knowledge Article View page route map routes the kb_article page to the kb_article_view page. By default, users with the public role cannot access the kb_article_view page. However, your administrator can modify this behavior. For more information, see Enable external or public users to view knowledge articles from the Knowledge Management Service Portal. 

 After activating the Knowledge Article View page route map, you can: 

**-** Comment on a knowledge article 

**-** Create an article version by importing a Word document 

**-** Create a version of a knowledge article from a managed document 

###### Procedure 

**1.** Navigate to **All** > **Service Portal** > **Page Route Maps**. 

**2.** Open the **Knowledge Article View** record. 

**3.** Select **Active**. 

**4.** Click **Update**. 

###### Result 

 Your end users view knowledge articles in the Service Portal using the kb_article_view page. 

 Activate Service Portal validation scripts 

 Validate user input in a specific field type using a validation script. In new instances, Service Portal includes XML, Script, Script (Plain), Email, and Version validation scripts by default. If upgrading from a previous release, the Mobile and Service Portal version is not active by default. You must activate the Mobile and Service Portal version of the validation script to validate user input in the Service Portal. 

###### Before you begin 

 Role required: admin 

###### About this task 

 Service Portal requires that the UI Type field be set to All or Mobile / Service Portal. Client Scripts marked as Desktop rely on legacy APIs that are not supported in Service Portal. Before flagging a script as Mobile / Service Portal or All, make sure you are only using supported clientside APIs. See Supported client script types and APIs. 

##### Note: To change the UI Type from Mobile / Service Portal to All , delete the Desktop 

 version from your instance to avoid activating conflicting scripts. Before deleting the Desktop version, make a backup in case you need to revert any changes. 

###### Procedure 

**1.** Navigate to **All** > **System Definition** > **Validation Scripts**. 

**2.** Open the Mobile / Service Portal version of the validation script you would like to use in the     Service Portal. 

**3.** Click the **Active** flag to activate the validation script. 

**4. Optional:** Set the UI Type to **All** to use the validation script in desktop, mobile, and Service     Portal environments.     To avoid activating conflicting validation scripts, you must first delete the Desktop version of     the script. 

© 2025 ServiceNow, Inc. All rights reserved. ServiceNow, the ServiceNow logo, Now, and other ServiceNow marks are trademarks and/or registered trademarks of ServiceNow, Inc., in the United States and/or other countries. 710 


 a. Navigate to the desktop version of the validation script you would like to replace. Desktop versions have the UI Type field set to Desktop. 

 b. Open the record. 

 c. Right-click the header menu and select Export > XML (This Record) to create a backup of the record. 

 d. Once the export completes, click Delete and confirm the selection. 

 e. Navigate back to the validation script set to Active in earlier steps and change the UI Type to All. 

###### Result 

 User input into the designated field type in the Service Portal and Mobile environments is validated for correct formatting. For example, if you activated the Email validation script for use in the Service Portal, invalid user input into an Email field generates an error and prevents the browser from submitting the form. 

##### Note: On a desktop browser, the field is validated when you submit the record. On a 

 mobile browser, the field is validated when you navigate away from the field. 

 Create a portal

 Migrate from the Virtual Agent Service Portal widget 

 If you are upgrading from a previous release, your portal implementation may include the Virtual Agent Service Portal widget. Migrate widget options to the Agent Chat in Service Portal configuration and remove all instances of the widget to enable your users to initiate and maintain an Agent Chat conversation in any portal page. 

###### Before you begin 

 Role required: (admin or none) 

###### Procedure 

**1.** Record instance options and delete instances of the Virtual Agent Service Portal widget. 

 a. Locate each instance of the Virtual Agent Service Portal widget and open the instance options. 

 b. Record the values. 

 c. Delete the widget instance. 

**2.** If your widget instance included a color instance option, add the color variable to the portal     theme record. 

 a. Navigate to Service Portal > Themes. 

 b. Open the theme record for the portal. 

 c. In the CSS variables field, add the $sp-agent-chat-bg variable and set the value to the desired color. 

 Example 

 $sp-agent-chat-bg: #ff0000 

**3.** If your widget instance options included URL parameters, add them to the Service Portal Agent     Chat Configurations form **Server script** field. 

##### Note: The portal suffix, page ID, and language are automatically available to Agent Chat 

 and do not require a custom script. Sys ID and table are automatically available to Agent Chat when they are present in the URL. 

© 2025 ServiceNow, Inc. All rights reserved. ServiceNow, the ServiceNow logo, Now, and other ServiceNow marks are trademarks and/or registered trademarks of ServiceNow, Inc., in the United States and/or other countries. 735 


 a. Navigate to the record in the Service Portal Agent Chat Configurations [sp_agent_chat_config] table for the desired portal. 

 b. In the Server script field, write a custom script to pass the parameters to Agent Chat. 

 Example 

 This example returns the value of the chat_queue field to the current conversation. 

 (function ($sp) { return { chat_queue: $sp.getValue('chat_queue') }; })($sp); 

###### Result 

 Widget instances are removed from individual portal pages. Instead, the portal applies the Service Portal Agent Chat Configurations record to every portal page. 

 Pass page data to Agent Chat 

###### Use the spContextManager class in a widget client script to pass dynamic page data to 

 Agent Chat. For example, pass the number of approvals in the Approvals widget to Agent Chat when a user initiates a conversation from the Service Portal homepage. 

###### Before you begin 

 Role required: admin Examine the widget to understand how data is passed to the widget client script. To make data 

###### available to Agent Chat, you must pass it to the spContextManager service. You can then 

 access the data in a Virtual Agent topic using the vaContext object. For more information about using context variables in Virtual Agent scripts, see Virtual Agent scripts. 

###### Procedure 

**1.** Open the widget in the widget editor. 

**2.** Update the widget client script. 

###### a. Inject the spContextManager service into the widget client script function. 

###### b. Pass variables to Agent Chat using the spContextManager API. 

 This example passes approval_count to Agent Chat. When a user initiates a conversation from the Service Portal homepage, the system appends &sysparm_approval_count=5 to the Agent Chat iframe URL. 

 function ($scope, spContextManager) { 

 spContextManager.addContext('agent-chat', { 'approval_count': 5 }); }; 

 Keys passed to this API are unique per page. For example, if the 'agent-chat' key is 

###### already initialized by another widget on the page through the addContext() method, you 

###### must use the updateContextForKey() method to update the key's data.. For more 

###### information about the spContextManager class, see spContextManager. 

**3.** Click **Save.**

**4.** Use Service Portal data in a Virtual Agent topic. 

 a. Navigate to Virtual Agent > Designer and open the topic in which you would like to use Service Portal data. 

 b. Click Edit Topic Flow. 

 c. Configure the topic as needed. In a script field, use the vaContext object to access the context variable passed from the Service Portal. 

 For more information about creating a Virtual Agent topic, see Create a Virtual Agent topic. 

 Example For example, this script accesses the value of the approval_count variable in the Approvals widget. 

 (function execute() { return "Your approval count is: " + vaContext.approval_count; })() 

 d. Save and publish the topic. 

###### Result 

 Agent Chat can access the variables when an end user initiates a conversation from the Service Portal page.

 Styling for right-to-left languages in portals 

 Localizing a portal for right-to-left languages requires CSS that mirrors the direction of portal pages. 

 Service Portal can generate the CSS required to mirror the user interface direction of the portal when the session language is a right-to-left language. The entire hierarchy of existing infrastructure for styling left-to-right languages—the theme, page, widget, and widget instance SCSS—is converted to CSS for right-to-left languages. All directional properties supported by RTLCSS are converted. However, plain CSS files included in any of the theme or widget dependency records, internal CSS, and inline CSS aren’t automatically converted. 

 Service Portal direction mirrored for Hebrew 

 You can also provide your own CSS for right-to-left languages to override the automatically generated CSS if you use an external CSS library and you can control the conversion of CSS for right-to-left languages using a variety of methods. 

##### Note: Base system portals besides Service Portal (/sp) and custom portals might need 

 additional CSS customization to mirror the direction of a portal for right-to-left languages completely. 

 To track how many users view a portal in a right-to-left language, see the PortalPageLoad event in User Experience Analytics for Service Portal. For more information about available events, see Service Portal events. 

 Mirror the portal direction for right-to-left languages 

 Mirror the direction of a portal's user interface for right-to-left languages by enabling the necessary CSS. 

###### Before you begin 

 Active a right-to-left language, such as Hebrew. For more information, see Activate a language.

###### Procedure 

**1.** Navigate to **All** > **Service Portal** > **Portals**. 

**2.** Select a portal. 

**3.** Select the **Support right-to-left languages** option. 

**4.** Select **Update**.     CSS that mirrors the direction of a portal's user interface for right-to-left languages is     generated. 

**5. Optional:** If you use an external CSS library for your portal theme, provide your own CSS that     mirrors the direction of a portal's user interface to override the automatically generated CSS. 

 a. Navigate to All > Service Portal > Themes. 

 b. Select the theme for the portal. 

 c. In the CSS Includes related list, select the CSS Include that links to an external CSS library URL. If you need to create a new CSS Include, see Create a portal theme. 

 d. In the RTL CSS file URL field, enter the URL to an external style sheet for mirroring the direction of a portal for right-to-left languages. 

 e. Select Update. 

###### Result 

 When the session language is a right-to-left language, the direction of the portal user interface is mirrored to display from right to left. 

 Trouble? 

 If any content in your portal isn’t automatically mirrored for right-to-left languages, see CSS for right-to-left languages in portals for information about how to resolve these issues. 

 CSS for right-to-left languages in portals 

 You can control the generation of CSS for right-to-left languages using a variety of methods. 

 Base system portals besides Service Portal (/sp) and custom portals might need additional CSS customization to mirror the direction of a portal for right-to-left languages completely. 

 Custom widgets might need some manual conversion for right-to-left languages. 

**-** For inline styles in a widget's HTML template, move these styles to the widget's CSS so they’ll     be automatically converted. 

**-** For internal styles in a widget's HTML template, you can use the [dir=”rtl”] attribute     selector or .rtl class selector to provide CSS that is specific to right-to-left languages. 

**-** To include CSS that is specific to right-to-left languages, you can call the isRTLEnabled()     method in the GlideSPScriptable - Scoped class in a widget’s server script or use the 

###### g_portal_isrtl global flag in the widget’s client script. 

 Also, in the theme, page, widget, or widget instance CSS, you can add right-to-left directives to CSS properties only using a Sass interpolation string (#{""}).

 CSS directives for right-to-left languages 

 Right-to-left CSS directive Description 

 /*rtl:ignore*/ Ignores the property when converting portal CSS for right-to-left languages. 

 /*rtl:prepend:10px*/ Adds a value to the beginning of the property value for right-to-left languages. This example prepends 10px. 

 /*rtl:append:3rem*/ Adds a value to the end of the property value for right-to-left languages. This example appends 3rem. 

 /*rtl:replace:30px*/ or / *rtl:30px*/ 

 Replaces the property value with the specified value for right-to-left languages. This example replaces the property value with 30px. 

 /*rtl:insert:25px*/ Inserts the specified value in place of the directive for right-to-left languages. This example inserts 25px. 

##### Example: Ignore the transform property in the converted right-to-left CSS 

 .fl { transform: rotate( 45 deg) translateY( 5 px) #{"/*rtl:ignore*/"}; } 

 Creating portal pages 

 Use pages to organize content, ensure responsive mobile optimization, and design meaningful portal user experiences for your customers. A page houses containers and rows, which then contain widgets. By manipulating the layout of the page, and the widgets within it, you can construct your desired user experience. 

**-** Pages are referenced using the page ID. 

**-** Pages can be referenced in more than one portal. 

**-** Use base system pages as templates.

##### Domain separation for a standard ticket page 

 Tab configurations aren’t domain-separated. 

 Ticket configurations are process domain-separated. For any request type record, when a user opens the standard ticket page, it checks for ticket configurations in the following order irrespective of the user's domain: 

**1.** In the record’s domain 

 a. Ticket configurations for the record table 

 b. Ticket configurations for the parent table of the record table 

**2.** In the record domain’s parent hierarchy 

 a. Ticket configurations for the record table 

 b. Ticket configurations for the parent table of the record table 

##### Note: For a table, only one active configuration is enabled per domain.

 Redirect a reference to a page ID 

 Redirect all references from Service Portal widgets to route to a new page with a single record to avoid manually replacing the hard-coded page ID in widgets. 

###### Before you begin 

 Role required: sp_admin 

###### About this task 

 Multiple widgets in Service Portal can link to a single page using a hard-coded page ID. This process allows you to replace page references in widgets without locating and replacing all references to the page ID by cloning and updating each widget. 

 To redirect all references to a page, create a record in the Page Route Map [sp_page_route_map] table. This table enables you to redirect a reference to a page without cloning base system widgets. 

 Creating a record in the Page Route Map table only redirects references to a page. It doesn’t redirect navigation to a page ID within a URL. 

##### Note: You don't need to create a page route map to redirect users to a 404 page. To 

 specify the 404 page for your portal, update the 404 page field in the Portal [sp_portal] record. 

###### Procedure 

**1.** Navigate to **All** > **Service Portal** > **Page Route Maps**. 

**2.** Select **New**. 

**3.** On the form, fill in the fields. 

 Field Description 

 Short Description Optional short description to describe the redirect. 

 Service Portal(s) Portals that apply the redirect. If you don't select a portal, the redirect applies to all portals in the instance. 

 Route from Original page you’re redirecting from. 

© 2025 ServiceNow, Inc. All rights reserved. ServiceNow, the ServiceNow logo, Now, and other ServiceNow marks are trademarks and/or registered trademarks of ServiceNow, Inc., in the United States and/or other countries. 765 


 Field Description 

 Route to Page you’re redirecting to. 

 Active Whether the Page Route Map record is active. The redirect only applies when the record is active. 

 Roles Roles to which the page route map applies. Users that don't have any of the roles specified in this field aren't redirected to the new page. If no roles are specified, the page route map is applicable to all users. 

 Order Priority of the Page Route Map record. If more than one active record has the same value in the Route from field, the record with the lowest order applies. The system evaluates records from lowest to highest. If multiple records have a matching order, the system honors the oldest record. 

**4.** Select **Update**. 

###### Result 

 All references to the page listed in the Route from field redirect to the page in the Route to field. 

 Attaching files to records from portal pages 

 Attachments can be added to records from portal pages by navigating the file system, pasting files from the clipboard, or dragging and dropping files. 

 By default, several base system widgets accept attachments from portal users using one or more of these methods. To modify how portal users can add attachments, you can clone and edit widgets to customize the file attachment experience as described in the following procedures. 

 To track how portal users attach files to records from pages in your portal, see the SP File Attach event in User Experience Analytics for Service Portal. For more information about available events, see Service Portal events. 

 Add attachments by pasting or dropping files 

 Allow portal users to attach files by pasting or dropping files in the Add attachments dialog box. 

###### Before you begin 

 By default, the Form, Ticket Attachments, Ticket Conversations, and SC Catalog Item base system widgets support adding attachments by pasting or dropping files in the Add attachments dialog box rather than only by navigating the file system. 

 To configure this functionality for other widgets, you can clone or create a widget that supports adding attachments with the sp-attachment-button directive. For more information about cloning widgets, see Clone a widget. 

##### Note: Base system widgets are read-only so you can benefit from future updates. To make 

 changes, you can clone base system widgets. However, cloned widgets are considered custom and don't benefit from future updates to the widgets they were cloned from. 

 Role required: sp_admin or admin 

###### Procedure 

**1.** Navigate to **All** > **Service Portal** > **Service Portal Configuration**. 

**2.** Select **Widget Editor**. 

© 2025 ServiceNow, Inc. All rights reserved. ServiceNow, the ServiceNow logo, Now, and other ServiceNow marks are trademarks and/or registered trademarks of ServiceNow, Inc., in the United States and/or other countries. 766 


**3.** In the Edit an existing widget menu, select the widget you cloned. 

**4.** In the **HTML Template** of the widget, locate the sp-attachment-button element. 

**5.** Configure attributes for the sp-attachment-button element. 

 ◦ modal: Enables copy-paste and drag-and-drop support when set it to true. 

 To turn off copy-paste and drag-and-drop support, set it to false. 

 ◦ supported-extensions: Displays a list of supported file extensions for attachments at the bottom of the Add Attachments dialog box. 

###### To list the supported file extensions specified by the glide.attachment.extensions 

 system property, set it to {{::data.supportedAttachmentExtensions}}. 

 Example 

 <sp-attachment-button modal="true" supported-extensions="{{::data.supportedAttachme ntExtensions}}" ></sp-attachment-button> 

**6.** Select **Save**. 

###### Result 

 On a page with the widget, you can paste or drop files over the Add attachment dialog box to attach them to the record, as shown in the following example. 

##### Note: This functionality isn't supported for mobile experiences. Pasting attachments isn’t 

 supported in Firefox. 

 Add a drag-and-drop zone for attaching files 

 Allow portal users to drop attachments in a dedicated zone of a page to quickly attach files to a record. 

###### Before you begin 

 To configure a drag-and-drop attachments zone on a page, you must clone or create a widget that supports adding attachments by calling attachmentHandler set to an instance of nowAttachmentHandler in its client script. For an example of a widget like this, see the Form widget. For more information about cloning widgets, see Clone a widget.

 changes, you can clone base system widgets. However, cloned widgets are considered custom and don't benefit from future updates to the widgets they were cloned from. 

 Role required: sp_admin or admin 

###### About this task 

 By default, portal users can add attachments on many base system pages by selecting the 

 Add attachments icon ( ) to open the Add attachments dialog box. With a drag-and-drop attachments zone, portal users can add attachments with fewer clicks. For example, you could drop attachments over an area of a catalog request or a form. 

 In this example, the zone is an area over the body of a form widget. The zone is only visible when moving a file over it. 

 Attachment zone over a widget 

###### Procedure 

**1.** Navigate to **All** > **Service Portal** > **Service Portal Configuration**. 

**2.** Select **Widget Editor**. 

**3.** In the Edit an existing widget menu, select the widget you cloned to add the attachment zone     to. 

**4.** In the **HTML Template** of the widget, add the sp-attachment-picker attachment-     handler="attachmentHandler" directive as an attribute of a <div> or <section>     element.     The zone can include the entire widget or only part of it. 

 Example 

 <div sp-attachment-picker attachment-handler="attachmentHandler" > 

**5. Optional:** Configure attributes for the sp-attachment-picker directive. 

 ◦ disable-picker-overlay="true": Turns off showing an overlay over the attachment zone when you drag a file over it. By default, the overlay is enabled. 

 ◦ onFilePick: Implements custom logic by triggering an event when any file is picked. Set the value to a function that takes in the references of all the selected files as an array as the first parameter. For example, on-file-pick="attachFiles($files)". Examples of custom logic that could be implemented include previewing the files, custom validations, or custom upload logic. If this attribute is configured, the attachmenthandler="attachmentHandler" attribute isn’t needed and can be removed.

**6. Optional:** Hide the attachment zone on mobile devices. 

 a. Add the ng-if="isDesktopBrowser" directive to the sp-attachment-picker directive. 

 Example 

 <div sp-attachment-picker attachment-handler="attachmentHandler" ngif="isDesktopBrowser" > 

 b. In the Client Script of the widget, add the following script. 

 Example 

 $scope.isNative = cabrillo.isNative(); $scope.isMobileBrowser = spUtil.isMobile() && !$scope.isNative; $scope.isDesktopBrowser = !$scope.isNative && !$scope.isMobileBrowser; 

**7.** Select **Save**. 

###### Result

 Using portal widgets 

 Widgets are what define the content of your portal pages. You can use the base system widgets provided with Service Portal, clone and modify widgets, or develop custom widgets to fit your own needs. 

 https://player.vimeo.com/video/1085023120? h=bd4199fd16&badge=0&autopause=0&player_id=0&app_id=58479 

 When you create or update a page in the Service Portal Designer, you easily add widgets by searching in the widget filter and dragging a widget onto the page. You can also access all widget records from the platform at All > Service Portal > Widgets. 

##### Base system widgets 

 You can use the base system widgets included with Service Portal to get started configuring portal pages. Base system widgets are read-only so you can benefit from future updates. However, for each instance of a base system widget that you add to a page, you can configure the instance options available for that widget. 

 For a list of base system widgets and information about their instance options, see the Widget library. 

##### Widget instances 

 When you add a widget to a page using the Service Portal Designer, it creates a widget instance. A widget instance is a reference to a widget that contains a location, properties, and CSS specific to that instance. Adding the same widget multiple times to the same page creates multiple instances. 

 All widget instances point to a widget. If you edit that widget, all of its widget instances receive that change as well. You can also make changes specific to a widget instance, and only that widget instance is affected. 

 For example, the following image includes four instances of the base system Icon Link widget with different configurations specific to each instance. 

© 2025 ServiceNow, Inc. All rights reserved. ServiceNow, the ServiceNow logo, Now, and other ServiceNow marks are trademarks and/or registered trademarks of ServiceNow, Inc., in the United States and/or other countries. 771 


 Icon link widgets 

##### Note: For widgets that do not contain any information by default, you must configure the 

 options for their widget instances before they will appear on a portal page. 

##### Widget context menu 

 From any rendered Service Portal page, you can CTRL+right-click a widget to see more configuration options in a context menu. 

 For example, navigate to Service Portal > Service Portal Home to open a sample portal page. CTRL+right-click Knowledge Base on that page. 

 Widget context menu 

##### Note: You must have the admin or sp_admin role to see the widget context menu. When 

 you impersonate a user without one of those roles, you can still see the menu. However, a regular user signed in without those roles can’t see the menu.

 Widget context menu options 

 Option Description 

 Widget performance How long it takes for a widget to load 

 Instance options Specify an instance of a widget. Widgets instance options vary depending on the widget that you select. For example, the instance options for the cool clock widget include different time zones for each instance, so you can have the same clock four times on a page, but with all different time zones. 

 Instance in Page Editor Opens that instance of the widget in the Page Editor 

 Page Designer Opens the widget in the Service Portal Designer, which lets you add containers, columns, and widgets. You can add styling from the Service Portal Designer to the widget or to the page the widget lives on. 

 Show Widget Customizations 

 Shows customization levels of widgets on the page so that you can diagnose page issues. For more information, see Widget diagnostics. 

 Edit Container Background 

 Edit the layout in which the widget is located. 

 Widget Options Schema Define the options that you can select for an instance of a widget. For more information on configuring your own instance options, see Widget option schema. 

 Widget in Form Modal Opens the widget form in a pop-up window so you can make quick changes to the widget. 

 Widget in Editor Opens the widget in the Widget Editor. You can use the Widget Editor to configure HTML templates, CSS, client scripts, service scripts, and demo data for the widget. 

 Log to console: $scope.data 

 The $scope.data object passes data from the server to the clientside controller. Instead of adding console.log messages or alerts into the controller code, you can log the $scope.data object to the browser console and view the data there. 

 Log to console: $scope Similar to the $scope.data object, except it logs everything in $scope to the console. 

##### Custom widgets 

 Base system widgets are read-only so you can benefit from future updates. To make changes, you can clone base system widgets. However, cloned widgets are considered custom and don't benefit from future updates to the widgets they were cloned from. You can also create widgets from scratch. To learn more about cloning or creating widgets, see Developing custom widgets. 

 Configure widget instances 

 Create unique instances of widgets by configuring the options for each instance. 

###### Before you begin 

 Create or edit a portal page and add widgets to it. You can also configure the existing widget instances on a base system page. For more information, see Create and edit a page using the Service Portal Designer.

**-** A reference to the widget 

**-** A reference to the column of the page where the widget is located 

**-** The configuration for a widget in the form of pre-defined form fields and an **Additional Options**     field in JSON format 

##### Note: For widgets that do not contain any information by default, you must configure the 

 options for their widget instances before they will appear on a portal page. 

###### Procedure 

**1.** Navigate to **All** > **Service Portal** > **Service Portal Configuration**. 

**2.** Select **Designer**. 

**3.** Select the page with the widget instance(s) you want to configure. 

**4.** In the Service Portal Designer, move to a widget instance and select the Edit icon ( ). 

**5.** In the instance options window, fill in the fields to configure the widget instance.     Instance options vary depending on which widget you select.

 Deferred loading of AI Search assets in Service Portal 

 Deferred loading of AI Search on the Service Portal delays the loading of certain AI Search assets until the main page content is loaded. This delay helps the page to load faster, thus improving user experience in the portal. st. 

###### A new system property, glide.service_portal.ais_defer_load_enable.list, 

 has been added to control for which portals deferred loading is applied. This property accepts a comma-separated list of portal url_suffix values. By default, deferred loading is enabled for the Service Portal. 

##### Note: If the web embeddable feature is enabled, loading of the AI Search assets can’t be 

 deferred. Instead, they load along with the other widgets on the portal page. 

 Configuring search in a portal 

 Service Portal displays search results data within a widget on the search page. To make data searchable from Service Portal, you can fetch data from a single table within your ServiceNow instance, from multiple ServiceNow tables, or from an external site. 

##### Search engines 

 AI Search 

 AI Search provides a modern consumer-grade search engine that is faster and more assistive than the legacy Zing search engine. Portal users can find answers more quickly and easily with features like auto-complete search queries, natural language support, and typo handling. AI Search is only supported in Service Portal, Employee Center (ESC), Consumer Service Portal, and Customer Service Portal. Custom portals must be built off a baseline of one of these portals to have the AI Search capability. 

 Zing 

 Zing is the legacy text indexing and search engine originally used by Service Portal. Some portals still use this search engine by default. 

##### Search analytics and suggestions 

 Generate relevant search suggestions for your users and monitor search analytics to understand what your users are searching for and whether they're finding what they need. Search Suggestions is a ServiceNow AI Platform feature. For more information, see Search Suggestions. 

 Generate suggestions from custom widgets 

 By default, the Search Events [sys_search_event] and Search Source Events [sys_search_source_event] tables collect search data from base system search widgets. To generate search analytics from custom Service Portal search widgets, use the GlideSPSearchAnalytics API. For more information, see GlideSPSearchAnalytics.

##### Performance recommendations 

 To avoid performance degradation and to ensure a fast search experience for end users, follow these recommendations. 

**-** Limit search sources when possible to perform only the necessary query. For example, if     a search only needs to return active incidents, add a condition to the search source set to     **[Active] [is] [true]**. A search that queries only active incidents is faster than a search that     queries all records in the incident table. 

**-** Create facet items and mapped queries with no more than 30 filter items. To verify, test each     search source with a variety of keywords as a user with low permissions. 

##### Note: Service Portal search results display as text only. HTML tags, images, and formatting 

 do not display in search results. 

 AI Search in Service Portal 

 Configure the ServiceNow AI Search application for Service Portal so that portal users can take advantage of intelligent query features and quickly find the answers they need. 

##### AI Search features 

 Powerful and flexible search 

 Unlike the legacy Zing search that was used in previous releases, AI Search is faster and more assistive. Portal users can find answers more quickly and easily with features like auto-complete search queries, natural language support, and typo handling. 

 Search suggestions 

 Typo handling

 With AI Search enabled in Service Portal, the portal search engine captures information about the user — such as their role, location, department, assets, and search history — and returns search results that are relevant and personalized. 

 AI Search also includes genius results that enable users to take action directly from the search results list.

 Search facets 

 Tab filters

 AI Search is enabled in Service Portal for all new and zBoot customers by default. 

 If you are upgrading to Zurich as an existing customer, AI Search is disabled in Service Portal by default. You can enable it by updating the portal record. 

 If you leave AI Search disabled, the portal uses the legacy search experience. 

###### Procedure 

**1.** Navigate to **Service Portal** > **Portals** and open a portal record. 

**2.** On the form, select **Enable AI Search**. 

**3.** In the **Search Application** field, select the search application configuration to use for the     portal. 

 A search application configuration defines search experience settings, such as the search engine, search results limit, and suggestions limit. A search application configuration is selected by default, but you can select a different configuration if needed. 

 For more information on defining a search application configuration, see Defining search application configurations. 

**4.** In the **Search Results Configuration** field, select the search results configuration to enable for     the portal. 

 A search results configuration defines how search results are displayed. A search results configuration is selected by default, but you can select a different configuration if needed. 

 For more information on defining a search results configuration, see Create an EVAM definition. 

**5.** Select **Update**. 

###### Result 

 AI Search is enabled throughout the portal. Employees or customers can use AI Search the next time they log in. 

 The Search Sources related list is hidden from the portal record. You now define search sources in the AI Search application. For more information, see Defining search sources. 

 To use AI Search for knowledge articles, you can keep the default Knowledge Bases search source or select a custom one. 

##### Note: If you're experiencing issues using AI Search for knowledge articles, check that 

 the associated search profile is linked to a knowledge bases search source. For more information, see Link a search source to a search profile.

###### What to do next 

 Search widgets that you cloned or customized before a system upgrade may not be compatible with AI Search. You can resolve this issue by running a fix script that reclassifies search widget instances. For more information, see Reclassify cloned or customized search widgets. 

 Reclassify cloned or customized search widgets 

 Search widgets that you cloned or customized before a system upgrade may not be compatible with AI Search. You can resolve this issue by running a fix script that reclassifies search widget instances. 

###### Before you begin 

**1.** Enable and configure AI Search in Service Portal 

**2.** Run the Portal Analyzer to identify all cloned or customized search widgets. For more     information, see Get a list of widgets per page. 

**3.** For each cloned or customized search widget, copy the sys_id value of each widget instance     that is associated with the widget. 

**4.** For each cloned or customized search widget, ensure that the widget and its corresponding     widget instances have the latest AI Search code from the base system search widget. 

##### Warning: Run the fix script only after you've updated all cloned or customized search 

 widgets. If you run the fix script without first updating the widget code, the widgets won't be able to uptake the AI Search code later. 

 Role required: admin 

###### About this task 

 If you're unable to use AI Search in Service Portal, you may need to reclassify your cloned or customized search widgets. You can run the Reclassifying Search widgets fix script, which 

###### reclassifies widget instances to the sp_instance_ais class. 

###### Procedure 

**1.** Navigate to **All** > **System Definition** > **Fix Scripts**. 

**2.** On the list, find and open the record named **Reclassifying Search widgets**. 

**3.** On the form, update the script to define which widget instances to reclassify.     Paste the sys_id value of each search widget instance in the array. For example, you would     enter the sys_id values as follows: 

 var instances = ["sys_id_1", "sys_id_2"]; 

**4.** Save the form. 

**5.** Select **Run Fix Script**.

 Zing search in Service Portal 

 Service Portal search supports the ServiceNow Zing text indexing and search engine. Zing allows you to index and search record data by table and is created entirely with ServiceNow code and implemented within the relational model. 

 To make data searchable from Service Portal, you create search sources that fetch data from a single table within your ServiceNow instance, from multiple ServiceNow tables, or from an external site. 

##### Search sources 

 A search source is a record that describes the behavior and source of searchable data. A search source defines: 

**-** Where to retrieve search data from. 

**-** Whether search suggestions can populate the search field based on user input. 

**-** How a search entry displays in the search result page. 

 Search sources have simple and advanced configurations. 

 Simple 

 Define a table within your ServiceNow instance as a source of searchable data. To learn more, see Define a search source. 

 When you create a simple search source, Service Portal uses the search engine settings configured on your instance. To learn more, see Zing text indexing and search engine. 

 Advanced 

 Define a data fetch script to return data. A data fetch script executes on the server and returns a result array to the search widget. This method is more complex, but offers complete power over how a search executes. You are not limited to querying single tables within ServiceNow and can define a script that fetches data from multiple tables, or from anywhere on the web. To learn more, review the Tutorial: set up an external knowledge base search source. 

##### Note: Search facets may not behave as expected if integrated into an 

 advanced search source that queries data from a nonServiceNow site. 

© 2025 ServiceNow, Inc. All rights reserved. ServiceNow, the ServiceNow logo, Now, and other ServiceNow marks are trademarks and/or registered trademarks of ServiceNow, Inc., in the United States and/or other countries. 885 


##### Text index groups 

 A text index group defines how users see search results. For example, combine search results from several sources, or set the weight of certain fields. Text index groups are a ServiceNow AI Platform feature. To learn more, see Configure multiple tables for indexing and searching. 

 Associate a portal with a text index group to create common search rules and to combine search results from all search sources in the group. If you have a custom search source or portal, consider whether you want to use the base system portal_index_group text index group, or create your own text index group. The base system text index group includes the Catalog items and Knowledge tables. When a user searches for an item in Service Portal, they see combined results from these tables. To add an index group to a portal, see Add a text index group to a portal. 

##### Note: Text index groups do not support external search sources. 

##### Search suggestions and typeahead search 

 Search suggestions replaces typeahead search in Service Portal. Update the 

###### glide.service_portal.search_as_you_type_behavior system property to 

 change this behavior. For more information, see Enable and disable search suggestions. Service Portal search widgets automatically use whichever feature you enable. 

##### Search facets 

 Enable your end users to filter search results for a more meaningful result set. Facets can return results based on: 

**-** Fields in a table such as **Active** or **Author**. 

**-** Query conditions such as **[Updated][After][Last week]**. 

##### Note: Only set search facets for indexed fields. Fields that are not indexed may take 

 longer to return results and are not optimized for a fast search experience. Learn more: Configure a table for indexing and searching. 

 Search facets render in the Faceted Search widget on the sp_search page. In new instances, search facets are enabled by default. If upgrading from a previous release, enable search facets by activating a record in the Page Route Maps [sp_page_route_map] table. See Enable search facets. 

 Simple 

 Enable end users to refine search results for a simple search source. You can create facets for a table search source that return results based on field values or query conditions. See Add facets to a simple search source. 

 Advanced 

 Define facets for advanced search sources using the Facet generation script on the search source record. Use facet APIs to create facets and assign ServiceNow facet items or mapped queries to the facet. 

 API Use 

 SPScriptedFacetService Scoped 

 Creates a single or multi choice facet. 

© 2025 ServiceNow, Inc. All rights reserved. ServiceNow, the ServiceNow logo, Now, and other ServiceNow marks are trademarks and/or registered trademarks of ServiceNow, Inc., in the United States and/or other countries. 886 


 API Use 

 SPScriptedFacet Scoped Defines facet items, filters, or mapped queries for the facet. 

 Define a search source 

 Configure a basic search source to query data from an instance table, or configure an advanced data fetch script to query data across multiple tables and data sources, or to pull data from anywhere on the web. 

###### Before you begin 

 Role required: admin 

###### Procedure 

**1.** In the platform UI, navigate to **Service Portal** > **Portals** and select the portal you want to add     search sources to. 

**2.** From the **Search Sources** related list, click **New** to add a search source. 

**3.** Define the fields on the **Search Source** form. 

 Search Source form 

 Field Description 

 Name The display value for the search category. 

 ID The record ID. The value should be unique, and should not include any spaces or special characters. 

 Application The scope of the search source. 

 Roles If the Service Portal User Criteria Support plugin is not enabled, define user roles to access this search source. 

 Search page template The HTML template that displays the search results. If defining a basic search source, you do not need to change the default template. 

 For an example of a modified template, see Tutorial: set up an external knowledge base search source. 

**4.** Complete the fields on the **Data Source** tab. 

 Field Description 

 Is scripted source Adds an advanced data fetch script. If configuring an instance table as the data source, do not check this option. 

 Data fetch script Script defining the endpoint and API calls to fetch data. This field is only visible when Is scripted source is selected. 

 For an example of a data fetch script, see Tutorial: set up an external knowledge base search source.

 Field Description 

##### Note: If defining a facet generation script, inject the facets 

 object into the data fetch script and update the script to generate data for each facet item. For an example, see the Knowledge Base and Service Catalog search sources. Search facets may not behave as expected if integrated into an advanced search source that queries data from a nonServiceNow site. 

 Facet generation script Script defining search facets for a scripted search source.^ Enable your end users to filter search results for a more meaningful result set. This field is only visible when Is scripted source is selected. 

##### Note: If defining a facet generation script, inject the facets 

 object into the data fetch script and update the script to generate data for each facet item. For an example, see the Knowledge Base and Service Catalog search sources. Search facets may not behave as expected if integrated into an advanced search source that queries data from a nonServiceNow site. 

 Table Select a table from the list that you want to draw your results from. You can select any table in the platform. For example, User [sys_user] or Knowledge [kb_knowledge]. 

##### Note: Only indexed tables return search results. Learn more: 

 Configure a table for indexing and searching. 

 Conditions Filters results based on defined conditions. For example, Active is True. 

 Primary display field Select which field you want to display on the search results page. For example, Name. 

 Display fields Select additional fields to display on the search results page. For example, User ID, Email, and City.

 Define the maximum number of results per query for the search source in the Search Page widget or Faceted Search widget instance options. 

**5.** Configure **Typeahead** settings to allow search results to populate the search field based on     user input. 

 Field Description 

 Enable typeahead Allows typeahead functionality. If you do not want to integrate typeahead into your search source, clear the check box. 

© 2025 ServiceNow, Inc. All rights reserved. ServiceNow, the ServiceNow logo, Now, and other ServiceNow marks are trademarks and/or registered trademarks of ServiceNow, Inc., in the United States and/or other countries. 888 


 Field Description 

 Advanced typeahead config 

 Optionally add an advanced typeahead script to configure the way search results display. For more information, see Create an advanced typeahead template. 

 Typeahead glyph Adds an icon beside each typeahead result. 

 Page Defines a service portal page to display the selected result. For example, if form is configured, a selected typeahead result opens in a form. 

**6.** Click **Submit**. 

###### What to do next 

 To enable end users to refine search results, Add facets to a simple search source. 

 Paginate search source results 

 Limit the number of results that a search source displays at one time to improve performance. End users can load more results as needed. 

###### Before you begin 

 Role required: admin or sp_admin 

###### About this task 

 If adding pagination to a simple search source, set Paginate results on the search source record to true. However, if adding pagination to an advanced search source, you must also modify the data fetch script to handle multiple pages of results. When a user loads more search results, the search source re-executes the data fetch script. 

##### Note: If paginating a search source with advanced facets, do not modify the facet 

 generation script to load facets based on the results from each page. Facets should enable end users to filter results from an entire result set, rather than page-specific results. 

###### Procedure 

**1.** In the platform UI, navigate to **Service Portal** > **Search Sources**. 

**2.** Open a search source to add pagination to. 

**3.** From the **Data Source** tab, set **Paginate results** to true.     Enabling this field adds a **Load more results** button to the search results page. This flag     automatically enables pagination for simple search sources. 

**4. Optional:** If the search source is advanced, modify the data fetch script to handle multiple     search result pages.     Update the data fetch script using one of the following GlideRecord APIs, depending on the     scope of the search source.

 Tutorial: set up an external knowledge base search source 

 Define an advanced search source to return data from any source on the Internet. To understand the power of search sources, follow this tutorial to set up an external knowledge base search source. 

###### Before you begin 

 Role required: none 

 To create an advanced search source, you need authenticated access to an external website via a REST API and basic knowledge of AngularJS. 

© 2025 ServiceNow, Inc. All rights reserved. ServiceNow, the ServiceNow logo, Now, and other ServiceNow marks are trademarks and/or registered trademarks of ServiceNow, Inc., in the United States and/or other countries. 892 


###### About this task 

 In this integration, you will: 

**-** Create a data fetch script that uses the ServiceNow Table API to query a knowledge base     from another ServiceNow instance. 

**-** Decode the JSON response and define the fields that the search widget expects. 

**-** Update the search sources HTML template to open the search result in the external site. 

###### Procedure 

**1.** In the platform UI, navigate to **Service Portal** > **Portals** and select the portal you want to add     the search source to. 

**2.** From the **Search Sources** related list, click **New**. 

**3.** Create a name and ID for the search source.     The ID should be unique, and should not include any spaces or special characters. 

**4.** On the **Data Source** tab, select the **Is scripted source** check box. 

**5.** Add content to the data fetch script field. 

 a. Define the search function to be executed by the instance. 

 Example 

 This example uses a Recordless RESTMessageV2 example , but you can modify this 

 example to use a pre-configured Outbound REST web service if needed, or create a more secure authentication profile. 

 (function(query) { var results = []; /* Calculate your results here. */ var url= "https://myInstance.service-now.com/api/now/table/kb_knowled ge?sysparm_query=GOTO123TEXTQUERY321%3D" + encodeURI(query) + "&sysparm_fields=sys_id%2Cnumber%2Cshort_description%2Ccateg ory%2Ctext"; var ws = new sn_ws.RESTMessageV2(); ws.setBasicAuth("search_user", "search"); ws.setHttpMethod("get"); ws.setEndpoint(url); 

 var jsonOutput = ws.execute(); 

 return results; })(query); 

##### Note: In the preceding example, ws.setBasicAuth requires a username and 

 password for the remote instance. For more detail, see RESTMessageV2 Scoped, Global. 

 b. Add an if statement to the data fetch script to decode the JSON object being returned, iterate over each result, and set expected fields. 

 Example 

 The final data fetch script: 

© 2025 ServiceNow, Inc. All rights reserved. ServiceNow, the ServiceNow logo, Now, and other ServiceNow marks are trademarks and/or registered trademarks of ServiceNow, Inc., in the United States and/or other countries. 893 


 (function(query) { var results = []; /* Calculate your results here. */ var url= "https://<my-instance>.service-now.com/api/now/table/kb_know ledge?sysparm_query=GOTO123TEXTQUERY321%3D" + encodeURI(query) + "&sysparm_fields=sys_id%2Cnumber%2Cshort_description%2Ccateg ory%2Ctext"; var ws = new sn_ws.RESTMessageV2(); ws.setBasicAuth("search_user", "search"); ws.setHttpMethod("get"); ws.setEndpoint(url); 

 var jsonOutput = ws.execute(); if (jsonOutput) { var response = new JSON().decode(jsonOutput.getBody()); results = response.result; results.forEach(function(result) { result.url = "https://myInstance.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_artic le=" + result.number; result.target = "_blank"; result.primary = result.short_description; }); } 

 if (jsonOutput.haveError()){ gs.addErrorMessage(jsonOutput.getErrorMessage()); } 

 return results; })(query); 

 In this example, the following fields are set on the result object: 

 ▪ url : If linking to an external site rather than opening the record in your ServiceNow instance, this defines where the link leads to. 

 ▪ target : The target for the link. Set the target to _blank to open results in a new tab, otherwise leave it blank. 

 ▪ primary : The primary field displayed in the search results. 

**6.** Update the search page template to open the search results in the external site. 

 Example 

 <div> <a href="https:// myInstance.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article={{item.nu mber}}" target="_blank" class="h4 text-primary m-b-sm block"> <span ng-bind-html="highlight(item.primary, data.q)"></span> </a>

 <span class="text-muted" ng-repeat="f in item.fields | limitTo: 4"> <span class="m-l-xs m-r-xs" ng-if="!$first"> &middot; </span> {{f.label}}: <span ng-bind-html="highlight(f.display_value, data.q)"></span> </span> </div> 

**7.** Click **Update**. 

###### Result 

 Test the external search in your portal. Results display under the name field value defined in step three. 

 Each search result opens in the external site defined in the search page template.

 ws.setBasicAuth("YOUR_USERNAME_HERE", "YOUR_PASSWORD_HERE"); var jsonOutput = ws.get(); if (jsonOutput) { var response = new JSON().decode(jsonOutput.getBody()); results = response.items; results.forEach(function(result) { result.url = result.svn_url; result.target = "_blank"; result.primary = result.full_name; }); } 

 return results; })(query); 

##### Note: In the preceding example, ws.setBasicAuth requires a username and 

 password for the external resource. For more detail, see GlideHTTPRequest Global. 

**6.** Use the Search page template to customize the way the search results display. 

 Example 

 <div> <div class="pull-right"> <strong>{{item.language}}</strong> <a ng-href="{{item.svn_url}}/stargazers" target="_blank" class="m-l-sm"><span class="fa fa-star m-r-xs"></span>{{item.stargazers_count}}</a> <a ng-href="{{item.svn_url}}/network" target="_blank" class="m-l-sm"><span class="fa fa-code-fork m-r-xs"></span>{{item.forks}}</a> </div> <a ng-href="{{item.svn_url}}" target="_blank" class="h4 text-primary m-b-sm block"> <span ng-bind-html="highlight(item.full_name, data.q)"></span> </a> <p>{{item.description}}</p> <p>Updated <sn-time-ago timestamp="item.updated_at"></sn-time-ago> ago</p> </div> 

 Enable search facets 

 In new instances, search facets are enabled by default. If upgrading from a previous release, enable search facets by activating a record in the Page Route Maps [sp_page_route_map] table. 

###### Before you begin 

 Role required: admin or sp_admin 

###### About this task 

 Search facets render in the Faceted Search widget on the sp_search page. To enable search facets after upgrade, activate the page route map record to route your search results to render in the sp_search page. 

© 2025 ServiceNow, Inc. All rights reserved. ServiceNow, the ServiceNow logo, Now, and other ServiceNow marks are trademarks and/or registered trademarks of ServiceNow, Inc., in the United States and/or other countries. 897 


###### Procedure 

**1.** Navigate to **All** > **Service Portal** > **Page Route Maps**. 

**2.** Locate the Search record in the list.     This record redirects users from the search page to the sp_search page when viewing search     results in Service Portal. The sp_search page includes the Faceted Search widget, which     supports search facets in both desktop and mobile environments. 

**3.** Set the **Active** field to true. 

###### Result 

 When using search in Service Portal, results render in the sp_search page. Add facets to the search source to enable end users to filter search results. To learn more about facets, see Add facets to a simple search source. 

 Add facets to a simple search source 

 Enable end users to refine search results for a simple search source. You can create facets for a table search source that return results based on field values or query conditions. 

###### Before you begin 

 Role required: admin or sp_admin 

 In new instances, search facets are enabled by default. If upgrading from a previous release, enable search facets by activating a record in the Page Route Maps [sp_page_route_map] table. See Enable search facets. Create facet items and mapped queries with no more than 30 filter items. To verify, test each search source with a variety of keywords as a user with low permissions. 

##### Note: Only set search facets for indexed fields. Fields that are not indexed may take 

 longer to return results and are not optimized for a fast search experience. Learn more: 

 Configure a table for indexing and searching. 

###### Procedure 

**1.** Navigate to **All** > **Service Portal** > **Search Sources**. 

**2.** Open or create a simple search source.     Simple search sources do not use a data fetch script. Rather, they define a table as the source     of searchable data. To learn more about search sources, see Configuring search in a portal. 

**3.** Select the **Facets** related list. 

**4.** Click **New**.     The Facet form displays. 

**5.** Complete the fields. 

 Field Description 

 Name Display name of the facet header. 

 Application Application scope of the search source. This value is read-only. 

 Selection type Type of user selection allowed: 

 ◦ Single : Only one filter value can be selected at a time. For example, if a facet is created for the Assigned to field, the end user can select Fred Luddy or Beth Anglin , but not both at the same time. Before filtering for a new value, the user must first clear the current value. 

© 2025 ServiceNow, Inc. All rights reserved. ServiceNow, the ServiceNow logo, Now, and other ServiceNow marks are trademarks and/or registered trademarks of ServiceNow, Inc., in the United States and/or other countries. 898 


 Field Description 

 ◦ Multiple : Multiple filter values can be selected at the same time. For example, if a facet is created for the Assigned to field, the end user can select both Fred Luddy and Beth Anglin. Because multi choice results in an OR query, records assigned to either Fred Luddy or Beth Anglin display. 

 Active Whether the filter option displays in search results. 

 Use mapped facet filters Maps a facet to a query condition, such as [Updated][After] [Last week]. 

 When selected, the Fields and Sort fields are removed from the form. After saving, define filters in the Facet Filters related list. 

 Order Defines the display order when multiple facets are defined. 

 If some facets do not have an order value defined, facets with an order defined display first. Facets without an order defined are displayed alphabetically. 

 Table Table that the query is created for. This value is read-only and defined by the table used in the search source. 

 Field Field that end users can filter search results by. For example, if Active is selected, the user can filter search results by true or false. 

 Only fields of the following types are supported: True/False, Choice, Decimal, Floating Point Number, Integer, IP Address, Long, Reference, String, String (Full UTF-8), and URL. 

 Sort Determines the order in which filter options display. 

 ◦ Ascending : Sorts filter options from A to Z when alphabetical, and from lowest to highest when numerical. This is the default option. 

 ◦ Descending : Sorts filter options from Z to A when alphabetical, and from highest to lowest when numerical. 

**6.** Save the record.     If **Use mapped facet filters** is selected, the **Facet Filters** related list appears in the facet form. 

**7. Optional:** If **Use mapped facet filters** is selected, define facet filters.     Map facet filters map a query condition to a facet label. When the end user selects the label     from the facet list, the defined query executes. 

 a. In the Facet Filters related list, click New. The Mapped Facet Form appears. 

 b. Define the facet filter fields.

 Facets do not display when the defined search source is selected in the sp_seach page. 

 Populate search suggestions in Service Portal 

 If you are upgrading from a previous release, run a script to populate search suggestions with data from a platform search table to provide search suggestions to your users. Alternatively, you can wait until users search for keywords instead of running this script. 

###### Before you begin 

 Role required: admin In new instances, the search suggestions are enabled by default. In upgraded instances, you 

 must enable the search suggestions. For more information, see Enable search suggestions. 

###### About this task 

 The ServiceNow AI Platform collects search data and analytics that generate search suggestions. If you are upgrading from a previous release, the search analytics do not contain any data yet. To 

© 2025 ServiceNow, Inc. All rights reserved. ServiceNow, the ServiceNow logo, Now, and other ServiceNow marks are trademarks and/or registered trademarks of ServiceNow, Inc., in the United States and/or other countries. 900 


 immediately provide suggestions to your users, you can populate the search suggestions using data from either the Text Searches [text_search] table or the Service Portal Log Entries [sp_log] table. The Service Portal Log Entries table includes search data from Service Portal only and may take less time to populate search suggestions. The Text Search table includes search data from the entire platform. 

 Search suggestions improve over time as more people use Service Portal. Search Suggestions is a ServiceNow AI Platform feature. For more information, see Search Suggestions. 

##### Warning: Populating search suggestions can be a resource-intensive task that may 

 take a while to complete. Do not run this script during peak hours. Populating search suggestions is not supported on domain-separated instances. 

###### Procedure 

**1.** Navigate to **All** > **System Definition** > **Scheduled Jobs**. 

**2.** Open the **Populate Suggestions to avoid Cold Start - Portals** scheduled job. 

**3.** Modify the script for your search implementation. 

 a. Define which portals the suggestions apply to. By default, the script populates suggestions in the base system service portal, but you can add as many as you want to the array. 

 var portals = ["Service Portal"]; 

 b. Change where the data comes from By default, the script imports data from the Text Searches [text_search] table, but you can change the source table to the Service Portal Log Entries [sp_log] table. The Service Portal Log Entries only saves records from the last 90 days. 

 var searchLogTable = "text_search"; 

 c. Push data to any custom search sources in your instance. 

 Suggestions are not enabled for external search sources. You must push data to both the search source name and the Sys ID. 

 For example, push text searches from the Incident table to your custom Incident search source. For more information about custom search sources, see Define a search source. By default, the system pushes text searches from the Catalog and Knowledge tables to the respective search sources. 

 Add the following code after line 11 in the script for each of your custom search sources. 

 searchSources.push("<search-source-table-name>"); searchSourceIds.push("<search-source-sys-id>"); 

 If the search source table does not exist, the system does not push suggestions to that search source. 

 d. Save the record. Make sure that the script includes the configuration you need. You can only run the script once.

**4.** Activate the record and select **Execute Now**.     Running this scheduled job populates the Search Events [sys_search_event], Search Source     Events [sys_search_source_event], and Search Suggestions [sys_search_suggestion] tables. 

###### Result 

 Users see suggestions when they start typing in a Service Portal search widget. 

 Add a text index group to a portal 

 Define how users see search results. For example, combine search results from several sources, or set the weight of certain fields. 

###### Before you begin 

 Role required: admin If you have a custom search source or portal, consider whether you want to use the base system portal_index_group text index group, or create your own text index group. The base system text index group includes the Catalog items and Knowledge tables. When a user searches for an item in Service Portal, they see combined results from these tables. 

##### Note: Index tables before adding them to a text index group. To learn more about text 

 indexing, see Configure a table for indexing and searching. 

 Text index groups are a ServiceNow AI Platform feature. To learn more, see Configure multiple tables for indexing and searching. 

###### About this task 

##### Note: Text index groups do not support external search sources. 

###### Procedure 

**1.** Navigate to **All** > **Service Portal** > **Portals**. 

**2.** Open the portal that you would like to add a text index group to. 

**3.** Configure the form to add the **Text Index Group** field. 

**4.** Add the text index group you want to the **Text Index Group** field. 

###### Result 

 Search results display according to the text index group's rules. 

 Set the default portal search source 

###### Use the glide.service_portal.default_search_sources system property to 

 define default search sources. 

###### Before you begin 

 Role required: admin 

###### About this task 

 If you don't define specific search sources for your portal, the system uses default search sources instead.

 Default search source flow chart 

###### Procedure 

**1.** In the Navigation filter, enter sys_properties.list.     The entire list of properties in the System Properties [sys_properties] table appears. 

**2.** On the list, find the system property 

###### glide.service_portal.default_search_sources, and then open the property 

 record. 

**3.** Copy the sys_ID of any search source you want to add into the **Value** field of the system     property using a comma-separated list. 

 To change the order in which the default search sources show in the Search List, change the order of the IDs in the property. 

 You can remove the default search source behavior by deleting the property value or deleting the property altogether. 

**4.** Click **Update**. 

 Configure Search Sources available on a page 

 Use contextual search to limit search results for an instance of the type-ahead search widget. 

 With contextual search enabled, users only see type-ahead results for specific search sources. For example, searching on the Service Catalog page only shows results from the Service Catalog search source when contextual search is enabled. 

**1.** In the Service Portal Designer ( **Service Portal** > **Service Portal Configuration** > **Service Portal**     **Designer** , find an instance of the type-ahead search widget. 

**2.** Point to the widget and click the edit icon ( ). 

 Alternatively, in any preview page containing the type-ahead search widget, for example the Service Catalog homepage, control + right-click to open the widget context menu. Then click Instance Options. 

© 2025 ServiceNow, Inc. All rights reserved. ServiceNow, the ServiceNow logo, Now, and other ServiceNow marks are trademarks and/or registered trademarks of ServiceNow, Inc., in the United States and/or other countries. 903 


**3.** In the Contextual Search Sources field, select search sources from the list. 

 Search sources listed for contextual search can be limited to just one, several, or all search sources. 

 Default search sources are defined in the 

###### glide.service_portal.default_search_sources property, so even if you do not 

 have search sources configured, type-ahead search widget still shows type-ahead suggestions. For more information on default search sources, see Set the default portal search source. 

 Managing portal access 

 Control user access to a portal. 

 Control who accesses your portal and what they can see in the following ways: 

**-** Authentication: Configure login and single sign on for users 

**-** Limit page access by role: Use roles to limit the users who can see a page. 

**-** Public pages: Use the _public_ check box on a page record to make the page publicly accessible. 

##### Note: A number of portal pages that are installed by default are marked public. Filter 

 your list of Service Portal pages for Public [is] true to identify these pages. Setting the Public value to false will prevent these pages from being publicly available. 

**-** User criteria: For a more advanced way of limiting user access, create and apply user criteria to     pages, widgets, widgets instances, and search sources. 

**-** Multifactor authentication: If an instance is configured to require multifactor authentication,     users are automatically directed to set up multifactor authentication upon initial login. For 

 setup instructions, see Setup multi-factor authentication upon initial login. If multifactor authentication is optional, users can still enable or disable authentication from their user profile. For setup instructions, see Setup multi-factor authentication on your user profile. 

 Single sign-on, logins, and URL redirects 

 Service Portal uses a combination of system properties and script includes to determine how the system handles URL redirects for users logging in to the portal. 

 Only users who understand SSO, URL redirects, and the ServiceNow platform should make any changes. 

##### Single sign-on and Service Portal 

 To use single sign-on with Service Portal, you must enable the Integration Multiple Provider Single Sign-On Installer plugin (com.snc.integration.sso.multi.installer). 

 If you are using the system property to automatically redirect to your primary IdP, then Service Portal automatically redirects to that IdP. If you have multiple identity providers, Service Portal shows a link on the login page to Use external login. For more information on SSO and authentication in the platform, see Multiple-Provider single sign-on (SSO). 

 To redirect users to the SSO Identify Provider (IdP) login page without first redirecting them to the portal login page, you can configure the 

###### glide.service_portal.sso.early_redirect.portals system property. For more 

 information, see Service Portal properties. If your portal uses a customized version of the Login widget, you must update the sp_sso_early_redirection UI macro as needed to redirect users to the SSO Identify Provider (IdP) login page without trying to load the portal page first.

##### Note: Service Portal has a known issue related to using Multi-Provider SSO and Okta. For 

 more information about this issue and a workaround, see the Service Portal: After enabling Multi SSO, end users are able to access navpage.do through OKTA if they are already logged in [KB0687717] article in the Now Support Knowledge Base. 

##### Require authentication for a Service Portal page 

 If you want to require authentication for a Service Portal page, ensure that the Public flag on the page record is not selected. For more information, see Create and edit a page using the Service Portal Designer. If a user navigates to a non-public page, they are redirected to the login page for the requested portal. 

 Because every page request is routed through the $sp page, this page must be public. The following values in the Public Pages sys_public table define the page as public: 

**- Page** : $sp 

**- Active** : true 

 Configure a portal as the instance login page 

 Direct all unauthenticated users to a portal login page to log in. The portal login page becomes the primary login page for your instance. 

###### Before you begin 

 Role required: admin 

###### Procedure 

**1.** Add a system property with the following settings: 

 ◦ Name: glide.entry.page.script 

 ◦ Type: string 

 ◦ Value: 

 new SPEntryPage().getLoginURL() 

**2. Optional:** If you need to direct users to a portal other than the default portal, edit the portal     specified in the SPEntryPage script include. 

 (Optional) SPEntryPage uses the default portal on the instance as the portal path to redirect to. Employee Center (esc) is the default portal by default. 

##### Note: If you edit the script include, it won't be upgraded with future updates. 

 a. Navigate to All > System Definition > Script Includes. 

 b. From the Script Includes [sys_script_include] table, search for a script include named SPEntryPage. 

 c. In the Script field, edit the script to change the assigned portal to the portal_suffix you want. 

 (Optional) For example, change this.portal = this.getDefaultPortal(); to this.portal = "/sp/"; to redirect to Service Portal. 

 SPEntryPage. prototype = {

 Redirect to Service Portal after login 

 Conditionally redirect users to a Service Portal page after logging in. 

###### Before you begin 

 Role required: admin 

###### Procedure 

**1.** Enter sys_properties.list in the navigation filter. 

**2.** In the System Properties [sys_properties] table, add the following properties and values. 

 Property Type Value Description 

 glide.entry.first.page.scriptstring new SPEntryPage().getFirstPageURL() 

 First page after authentication 

 glide.entry.page.script string Server script that redirects users to where to log in. For example: 

 new SPEntryPage().getLoginURL() 

 Contains the call to the server script include method that determines where to log in 

 getFirstPageURL primarily does the following: 

 ◦ Redirects to login_redirect.do to break out of the frameset (if there is one). 

 ◦ Redirects to the default portal if the user has no roles or to the full platform for users with roles who are not trying to go to a portal directly. 

 When the user has no roles, they are redirected to the portal equivalent of a page. For example, 

 https://<instance_name>.service-now.com/nav_to.do? uri=change_request_list.do 

 sends users without roles to: 

 https://<instance_name>.service-now.com/sp/? id=list&table=change_request. 

##### Note: This change does not prevent users without roles from accessing the full 

 platform. To prevent users without roles from accessing the platform and always redirect 

###### to a portal, set the value of the glide.entry.loggedin.page_ess system 

 property to the portal suffix, such as /sp. 

**3. Optional:** Customize the after-login behavior in the **SPEntryPage** script include.

 (Optional) For more information about modifying script includes, see Script includes. 

 For example, if you want users with certain roles to be redirected to Service Portal, you could modify user.hasRoles() in the following code. 

 if (user.hasRoles() && !redirectURL && !isServicePortalURL) 

##### Note: 

 ◦ If you edit the script include, it won't be upgraded with future updates. 

 ◦ Users with the admin role always pass a user.hasRoles() check. 

 ◦ If you are using external authentication, ensure that your IdP supports the RelayState URL parameter. This parameter retains the originally requested URL while the user authenticates, and is necessary for redirection after login. 

###### What to do next 

 To debug redirection, see Debug Service Portal URL redirects. For additional redirection troubleshooting information, see the Frequently Asked Questions on redirection with service portal [KB0747432] article in the Now Support Knowledge Base. 

 Debug Service Portal URL redirects 

 Debug the URL redirects for logging in to Service Portal and redirecting to the first page. 

 To view debug output from SPEntryPage and see the session variables it redirects based on: 

**1.** Make sure the system property glide.entry.first.page.script has the value: new     SPEntryPage().getFirstPageURL(). 

**2.** From the SPEntryPage script include, set this.logVariables = true. 

**3.** In a separate browser, log in. 

**4.** From the system navigator, view the log output by navigating to **System Logs** > **System Log** >     **All**.

 ◦ To make a page public, select the Public check box. All users can access pages marked as Public. 

 ◦ To limit access to a certain role, add roles in a comma separated list. Users without the role listed can see links to the page if they appear in the portal. Trying to open the page results in a "page not found" error. 

##### Note: If you select Public and add a list of roles, the page is still accessible by any 

 user. 

 ◦ To create a draft page that only administrators can see while the page is still in development, select Draft. Users must have the admin role to see any pages in draft. Everyone else sees a "page not found" error. 

**5.** Click **Save**.

 User criteria for Service Portal 

 User criteria enables you to allow access to users based on role, department, group, location, or company. Administrators can control access to pages, widgets, widget instances, announcements, and search sources in a portal by creating and applying user criteria. 

 User criteria records define conditions that are evaluated against user records. When user criteria is defined, portal records are only visible to users who pass the defined conditions. 

 User criteria is a platform feature used in Service Portal. Learn more about user criteria in the ServiceNow AI Platform: 

**-** Service Catalog: Set security for items and categories. 

**-** Knowledge management: Control access at the knowledge base level through user criteria. 

##### Important: After making user criteria additions or changes, you may need to log out and 

 log back in to clear the prior configuration. 

##### Converting role-based permissions to user criteria records 

 User criteria in Service Portal replaces role-based permissions. After activating the user criteria for Service Portal plugin, you must Set the user criteria for Service Portal system property to true. When the system property is set to true, any existing roles defined for a page, widget, or search source are automatically converted into user criteria records. To disable user criteria and continue using role-based permissions, set the system property to false. 

##### User criteria checks 

 User criteria uses the following checks in Service Portal to verify user access.

 Field Description 

 Application Application scope for the user criteria record. 

 Active Activate or deactivates this criteria record. 

 Companies Companies to match access criteria. 

 Locations Locations to match access criteria. 

 Departments Departments to match access criteria. 

 Match All Determines whether all elements from each populated criteria field must match. If selected, only users who match all criteria are given access. If cleared, the user must meet one or more of the set criteria to be given access. 

 By default, this check box is cleared so that any condition met provides a match. 

 For example, consider a user criteria record for the following: 

 ◦ Locations A or B 

 ◦ Company C or D 

 With Match All selected, only users meeting all these conditions are matched. For example, a user with a location A and a company C. 

 With Match All cleared, users meeting any of these conditions are matched. For example, a user with a location B. 

##### Note: If you select Match All , ensure that you do not create 

 contradictory conditions that can never be met. For example, if all users in location A work for company G, then the conditions in this example can never be met.

 Deactivate a portal 

 Turn off access to a portal that you no longer want users to visit and optionally redirect them to another portal. 

###### Before you begin 

 Role required: sp_admin or admin 

###### About this task 

 After you deactivate a portal, users are either redirected to an alternate portal that you configure, or they receive a message that the portal is inactive. 

 If an alternate portal is selected, pages are redirected by replacing the URL suffix of the inactive portal with the suffix of the alternate portal. To confirm that users are redirected to the correct page, complete the following steps: 

© 2025 ServiceNow, Inc. All rights reserved. ServiceNow, the ServiceNow logo, Now, and other ServiceNow marks are trademarks and/or registered trademarks of ServiceNow, Inc., in the United States and/or other countries. 926 


**-** Verify that all necessary resources, such as knowledge base articles and catalog items, are     available on the alternate portal. 

**-** If different pages are used on each portal, set up page route maps to map pages from the     inactive portal to the alternate portal. For more information, see Redirect a reference to a page     ID. 

**-** If customizations exist for page redirects using the SPEntryPage script include or other     methods, test these customizations thoroughly to confirm that there are no conflicts or remove     the customizations. For more information, see Single sign-on, logins, and URL redirects. 

 To support deactivating and reactivating public portals without search engines deindexing their pages, temporary HTTP 302 redirects are used for inactive portals. 

###### Procedure 

**1.** Navigate to **All** > **Service Portal** > **Portals**. 

**2.** Select a portal. 

##### Note: You can't deactivate the default portal on an instance or any portal configured 

 as an alternate portal for an inactive portal. You can't deactivate or redirect to the Mobile Employee Service Portal (/mesp). 

**3.** Select **Inactive**. 

**4. Optional:** In the **Alternate portal** field, select an active portal to which to redirect users who     attempt to access the inactive portal.     Multiple inactive portals can redirect to the same alternate portal. 

**5.** Select **Update**. 

###### Result 

 If you selected an alternate portal, users attempting to access the inactive portal are redirected to the alternate portal. They receive a message informing them that they've been redirected. For example: 

 If you don’t specify an alternate portal, users receive a message that the portal has been deactivated. You can customize these messages from the Message [sys_ui_message] table. For more information see, Message table. 

 To reactivate a portal, clear the Inactive option. 

##### Developing custom widgets 

 Develop custom widgets for portals using AngularJS, Bootstrap, and the ServiceNow API. 

##### Before you begin 

 To develop widgets, you need ServiceNow API experience to: 

**-** Run record queries on the server. 

**-** Create and update records. 

 You need AngularJS experience to: 

© 2025 ServiceNow, Inc. All rights reserved. ServiceNow, the ServiceNow logo, Now, and other ServiceNow marks are trademarks and/or registered trademarks of ServiceNow, Inc., in the United States and/or other countries. 927 


**-** Bind variables to client controllers. 

**-** Access server objects in a widget. 

**-** Gather user input. 

 Optionally, you can build on the Bootstrap template by accessing Bootstrap components. 

##### Parts of a widget 

 Like Angular directives, widgets execute a specified behavior within a Service Portal page. A widget includes mandatory and optional scripting components. 

 HTML template 

 A mandatory widget component. 

 The HTML template requires knowledge of AngularJS to display and gather data. Use the HTML template to: 

**-** Render the dynamic view that a user sees in the browser using information from     the model and controller. 

**-** Bind client script variables to your markup. 

**-** Gather data from the end user. 

 Client script 

 A mandatory widget component. 

 A client script requires knowledge of both the ServiceNow API and AngularJS to create a client controller. Use the client script to: 

**-** Map server data from JavaScript and JSON objects to client objects. 

**-** Process data before rendering it. 

**-** Pass data to the HTML template. 

**-** Pass user input and data back to the server for processing. 

 Server script 

 A mandatory widget component. 

 A server script requires knowledge of the ServiceNow API to work with record data. Use the server script to: 

**-** Set the initial state of the widget. 

**-** Send record data to the widget client script using the **data** variable. 

**-** Run server-side queries. 

 Link function 

 An optional widget component. 

 The link function requires knowledge of AngularJS. Use a link function to directly manipulate the DOM. 

© 2025 ServiceNow, Inc. All rights reserved. ServiceNow, the ServiceNow logo, Now, and other ServiceNow marks are trademarks and/or registered trademarks of ServiceNow, Inc., in the United States and/or other countries. 928 


 Option schema 

 An optional widget component. 

 Allows a Service Portal admin to configure a widget. Use the option schema to: 

**-** Specify the parameters for a widget. 

**-** Allow admin users to define instance options for a widget instance. 

**-** Develop flexible, reusable widgets. 

 Angular Providers 

 An optional widget component. 

 Angular Providers require knowledge of AngularJS. Use Angular Providers to: 

**-** Keep widgets in sync when changing records or filters. 

**-** Share context between widgets. 

**-** Maintain and persist state. 

**-** Create reusable behaviors and UI components and inject them into multiple     widgets. 

 Dependencies 

 An optional widget component. 

 A widget dependency is an external resource used by your widget such as JavaScript or CSS files. 

##### Global objects in widgets 

 When a widget begins to render for the first time on a page, the server script executes first and accesses three global objects: input , options , and data. Because the input variable is a data object sent from the client script, this variable is undefined when first initialized. 

 When a widget is first instantiated, the server script: 

© 2025 ServiceNow, Inc. All rights reserved. ServiceNow, the ServiceNow logo, Now, and other ServiceNow marks are trademarks and/or registered trademarks of ServiceNow, Inc., in the United States and/or other countries. 929 


**1.** Initializes an empty **data** object. 

**2.** Initializes the **input** object with any data sent from the client controller, or the **options** object     with any data used to initialize the widget. 

**3.** Sends the **data** object to the client controller as JSON. 

 The client script: 

**1.** Accesses the server **data** object using c.data. 

##### Note: By default, widgets use the c variable to represent the controller instance using 

 controller as syntax. You can change this variable when creating or cloning widgets. 

**2.** Uses server.update() to post changes to the data model. This method updates the     server script using the **input** object. 

##### Note: After calling server.update(), the client script data object is automatically 

 overwritten by the server script data object. 

**3.** Uses c.options to access the values used to invoke the widget on the server. This object is     read-only. 

##### Using the Widget Editor 

 When you create a widget, a record is created in the sp_widget table. However, you can use the Widget Editor in Service Portal Configuration as your scripting environment. The Widget Editor is a full page application similar to an IDE. You can show the parts of the widget you want to edit and hide the rest, while previewing your changes in real time. 

##### Note: For server-side scripts, you can turn on using the ECMAScript 2021 (ES12) 

 JavaScript mode if your application uses ES5 Standards mode or Compatibility mode. Scripts in applications with the JavaScript mode set to ECMAScript 2021 (ES12) use ECMAScript 2021 (ES12) by default. For more information, see Turn on ECMAScript 2021 (ES12) mode for a script. 

 General guidelines for developing widgets 

 When developing custom widgets, keep these general guidelines in mind for optimal performance, scalable development, and a good user experience. 

 Create a default state that provides an example to the end user 

 A widget does not have instance options defined when initially added to a page. A widget in this empty state can appear blank and cause confusion. In situations 

© 2025 ServiceNow, Inc. All rights reserved. ServiceNow, the ServiceNow logo, Now, and other ServiceNow marks are trademarks and/or registered trademarks of ServiceNow, Inc., in the United States and/or other countries. 930 


 where a widget requires some initial configuration, ensure that your widget has a default state that communicates to the admin what configuration is necessary. 

 Widgets can also be created with demo data. Demo data can also be used to: 

**-** Clearly demonstrate the widget functionality to the user. 

**-** Provide data when previewing the widget in the widget editor. (Demo data is not     visible in the designer). 

 Learn more: Tutorial: Build a custom widget. 

 Embed a widget rather than clone when possible 

 Embedding an existing widget into your custom widget takes advantage of preexisting functionality without cloning or duplicating code. You can still pass parameters into the embedded widget to control its behavior. 

 Learn more: Embed an existing widget 

 Avoid using large data sets to improve performance 

 Querying data, evaluating ACLs, running business rules, and data processing take time and can slow performance. Determine how much data portal users need and then apply the appropriate limits and filters to your scripts and queries. Isolate widgets that require significant data or processing to their own separate pages in the portal. Avoid implementing the following items that use large data sets: 

**-** Scripted menu items that load large amounts of data, which can cause every page     in the portal to load slowly. 

**-** Large files and attachments, such as high-definition media files or fonts from the     Attachments [sys_attachment] table. 

**-** Auto-refreshing widgets. Every time a widget's client controller calls 

###### server.update(), spUtil.update(), server.refresh(), or 

###### spUtil.refresh(), the application runs the widget's server script and sends 

 a data object back to the client. 

**-** Unfiltered record watchers. The recordWatch() function watches for updates     to a table or filter and returns the value from the callback function. Adding filters     for specific fields to watch reduces the number of calls a widget makes to the     server. Specifying when to refresh widgets in response to a record producer     notifying the client that there is an update in the callback function can also     improve performance. 

**-** Server-side scripts with GlideRecord queries without the setLimit function.     Using the setLimit function can restrict the number of records returned and     improve response time on queries. For added flexibility, you can tie this limit     to an instance option rather than assigning a hard-coded value (for example:     gr.setLimit(options.limit || 100)). 

 Learn more: 

**-** Six common performance pitfalls in Service Portal and how to avoid them     [KB0634588]

 Create a directive instead of embedding a complex widget 

© 2025 ServiceNow, Inc. All rights reserved. ServiceNow, the ServiceNow logo, Now, and other ServiceNow marks are trademarks and/or registered trademarks of ServiceNow, Inc., in the United States and/or other countries. 931 


 When an embedded widget is called from the server, all the scripts associated with that widget are returned. If you only need a subsection of a widget, embedding the entire widget creates unnecessary overhead. Instead, use directives to share lightweight code between widgets. Directives are useful, for example, when building UI components. Complex components with server-side and client-side functionality are best left as widgets. Use a directive instead of an embedded widget to: 

**-** Share scope or custom scope behavior with multiple widgets. 

**-** Share a reusable, lightweight subsection of a widget. 

**-** Share a common UI feature, such as a list or an avatar. 

**-** Augment widget behavior. 

 Learn more: Reuse components with Angular Providers. 

 Use a service or factory to share data and persist state 

 Data services and factories maintain and persist state in a widget without requiring multiple calls to the server, enabling you to: 

**-** Keep widgets synchronized when changing records or filters. 

**-** Share data between widgets. 

**-** Develop more performant widgets. 

 Learn more: Reuse components with Angular Providers. 

 Handle events with a publish/subscribe service 

###### Avoid using $broadcast in the DOM. $broadcast dispatches the event name to 

 all child scopes notifying registered listeners, which can be an expensive call that 

###### requires the use of the $rootScope global object. 

 Instead, use a publish/subscribe service to handle events. When using a publish/ subscribe service, a clear relationship forms between your widgets through callback handlers. In this model, you can better control the state of your events. 

 Use REST calls or server.get to fetch data from the server 

 When you call server.update(), the entire widget is returned from the server. If your widget includes divergent code paths, multiple calls to update the server can affect performance. As a rule, use your server script to set up the initial state of your widget. For subsequent updates, use scripted REST APIs that call script includes on your instance. This practice: 

**-** Separates business logic from UI elements. 

**-** Centralizes your code, allowing changes to be made in one place. 

 You can also use server.get to pass information to the server. Use this function along with input.action to execute specific parts of the server script. 

 Develop with localization, accessibility, and UI in mind 

 To create the best experience for your users, follow these guidelines: 

© 2025 ServiceNow, Inc. All rights reserved. ServiceNow, the ServiceNow logo, Now, and other ServiceNow marks are trademarks and/or registered trademarks of ServiceNow, Inc., in the United States and/or other countries. 932 


**-** Consider the impact of your widget in a mobile environment. For example, avoid     using mouse-over and other events that do not translate to a mobile device. 

**-** Use SCSS variables to reuse items. See SCSS variables. 

**-** Use variable names when using colors. 

**-** Wrap strings for translation in localization APIs. See Internationalize a widget. 

 Remove unused Angular Providers from client script 

 For easier maintenance, remove any unused Angular Providers that were injected into the client script function statement. 

 Avoid using <script> tags in HTML templates 

 To lessen the likelihood of production issues in Service Portal, avoid using inline templates using <script> tags in a widget's HTML template. Instead, create a related Angular ng-template record for the widget. 

 Tutorial: Build a custom widget 

 Follow this tutorial to build a custom widget that displays Service Catalog items. Use this tutorial as a model to help you understand the advanced scripting power of the Service Portal. 

 In this tutorial, you will create the Quick Order widget. This widget: 

**-** Displays popular items to the user prior to any search. 

**-** Queries the Service Catalog and displays available options to the user. 

**-** Includes an embedded SC Catalog Item widget, allowing the user to view and order items     within the Quick Order widget. 

**-** Uses an Angular Provider to display a category icon beside each queried item.

 ◦ sp_column 

 ◦ sp_instance 

 ◦ sp_widget 

##### Note: You can use the Page Editor in Service Portal Configuration to view the hierarchy 

 of elements on your test page. 

**4.** Click **Submit**. 

**5.** From the **Widget Editor** , open the Quick Order widget. 

**6.** Add the following simple template to the HTML field. 

 <div class="panel panel-primary"> <div class="panel-heading">Request an item from the catalog</div> <div class="panel-body"> My catalog results </div> </div> 

**7.** Click **Save**. 

**8.** Preview your test page in a new tab using the following URL: <yourInstanceUrl>/sp?     id=quick_order. 

 Your widget template displays on the test page. 

 Add a server script to query an instance table 

 After adding your widget and creating a basic template, you can define advanced client and server scripts that enable users to query data from an instance table. You can pass the data model between the client and server by querying data from the database, displaying it to the user, and sending any updates back to the server. 

###### Before you begin 

 Role required: admin or sp_admin 

###### Procedure 

**1.** From the **Widget Editor** , open the Quick Order widget. 

**2.** Select **Server Script** to open the server script field. 

**3.** Replace the default server script with the following custom script. 

 ( function () { if (input.keywords != null && input.keywords != '') data.items = getCatalogItems(input.keywords); 

 function getCatalogItems(keywords) { var sc = new GlideRecord('sc_cat_item'); sc.addActiveQuery(); sc.addQuery('123TEXTQUERY321', keywords); 

© 2025 ServiceNow, Inc. All rights reserved. ServiceNow, the ServiceNow logo, Now, and other ServiceNow marks are trademarks and/or registered trademarks of ServiceNow, Inc., in the United States and/or other countries. 934 


 sc.addQuery('sys_class_name', 'NOT IN', 'sc_cat_item_wizard,sc_cat_item_content'); sc.addQuery('sc_catalogs', 'e0d08b13c3330100c8b837659bba8fb4'); sc.setLimit( 100 ); sc.orderByDesc("ir_query_score"); sc.query(); var results = []; while (sc.next()) { if (!$sp.canReadRecord(sc)) continue ; 

 var item = {}; $sp.getRecordDisplayValues(item, sc, 'name,price,sys_id'); item.category = sc.getValue('category'); results.push(item); } return results; } })(); 

 This script performs a keyword search on the sc_cat_item table using the 123TEXTQUERY321 query method. 

**4.** Replace the HTML template with the following script: 

 <div class="panel panel-primary"> <div class="panel-heading">Request an item from the catalog</div> <div class="panel-body"> <input class="form-control" type="search" placeholder="Start typing here to search the list of catalog items" ng-model="c.data.keywords" ng-change="c.server.update()" ng-model-options="{debounce: 250}" /> <ul class="list-group result-container"> <li class="list-group-item" ng-repeat="item in c.data.items"> <a href>{{item.name}}</a><span class="pull-right">{{item.price}}</span> </li> </ul> </div> </div> 

 This template adds a search field and displays the results of the query performed in the server script using the following Angular directives. To learn more about these directives, review the Angular API Reference. 

 Angular directives used in the template 

 Angular directive Description 

 ng-model Automatically reads and writes value changes to the model variable c.data.keywords. 

 ng-model-options Configures ng-model behavior. In this template, ng-model updates the model after a user has stopped typing for 250 milliseconds. 

© 2025 ServiceNow, Inc. All rights reserved. ServiceNow, the ServiceNow logo, Now, and other ServiceNow marks are trademarks and/or registered trademarks of ServiceNow, Inc., in the United States and/or other countries. 935 


 Angular directive Description 

 ng-change Executes c.server.update() after the model value changes. This function posts the data object to the server script. After the script is executed, the data object is automatically updated with the new values from the server generated data object. 

 ng-repeat Creates a template from the parent element and child elements. For each item in c.data.items, an instance of the template is created and the expressions {{item.name}} and {{item.price}} are replaced with the values from each item. 

**5.** Add the following script to the **CSS - SCSS** field: 

 .result-container { margin-top : 10 px; } 

**6.** Refresh your test page preview to view the changes. 

 As you type in the search box, matching catalog items appear. Try searching for ipad. 

 Manage the empty state of a widget 

 Display a list of popular items to the user before any search terms are entered. 

###### Before you begin 

 Role required: admin or sp_admin 

###### About this task 

 Because no search has been executed when the widget initializes, the server input variable is undefined. This empty state may cause confusion when a user first interacts with the widget. To solve this issue, give your widget something to display when the input variable is empty. This initial data can guide your users when initially interacting with your widget. 

###### Procedure 

**1.** From the **Widget Editor** , open the Quick Order widget. 

**2.** Replace the existing server script with the following script: 

 ( function () { if (input.keywords != null && input.keywords != '') data.items = getCatalogItems(input.keywords); else data.items = getPopularItems(); 

© 2025 ServiceNow, Inc. All rights reserved. ServiceNow, the ServiceNow logo, Now, and other ServiceNow marks are trademarks and/or registered trademarks of ServiceNow, Inc., in the United States and/or other countries. 936 


 function getCatalogItems(keywords) { var sc = new GlideRecord('sc_cat_item'); sc.addActiveQuery(); sc.addQuery('123TEXTQUERY321', keywords); sc.addQuery('sys_class_name', 'NOT IN', 'sc_cat_item_wizard,sc_cat_item_content'); sc.addQuery('sc_catalogs', 'e0d08b13c3330100c8b837659bba8fb4'); sc.setLimit( 100 ); sc.orderByDesc("ir_query_score"); sc.query(); var results = []; while (sc.next()) { if (!$sp.canReadRecord(sc)) continue ; 

 var item = {}; $sp.getRecordDisplayValues(item, sc, 'name,price,sys_id'); item.category = sc.getValue('category'); results.push(item); } return results; } 

 function getPopularItems() { var items = []; var count = new GlideAggregate('sc_req_item'); count.addAggregate('COUNT', 'cat_item'); count.groupBy('cat_item'); count.addQuery('cat_item.sys_class_name', 'NOT IN', 'sc_cat_item_guide,sc_cat_item_wizard,sc_cat_item_content'); 

 count.addQuery('cat_item.sc_catalogs', 'e0d08b13c3330100c8b837659bba8fb4 '); count.orderByAggregate('COUNT', 'cat_item'); count.query(); while (count.next() && items.length < 9 ) { if (!$sp.canReadRecord("sc_cat_item", count.cat_item.sys_id.getDisplayValue())) continue ; // user does not have permission to see this item 

 var item = {}; item.name = count.cat_item.name.getDisplayValue(); item.category = count.cat_item.category.toString(); item.price = count.cat_item.price.getDisplayValue(); item.sys_id = count.cat_item.sys_id.getDisplayValue(); items.push(item); } return items; } })(); 

 This script introduces a new function getPopularItems() to query the database and return popular items when the input variable is empty.

**3.** Replace the HTML template with the following script: 

 <div class="panel panel-primary"> <div class="panel-heading">Request an item from the catalog</div> <div class="panel-body"> <input class="form-control" type="search" placeholder="Start typing here to search the list of catalog items" ng-model="c.data.keywords" ng-change="c.server.update()" ng-model-options="{debounce: 250}" /> <h5 ng-if="!c.data.keywords">Showing the most popular items</h5> <ul class="list-group result-container"> <li class="list-group-item" ng-repeat="item in c.data.items"> <a href>{{item.name}}</a><span class="pull-right">{{item.price}}</span> </li> </ul> </div> <div class="panel-footer" ng-if="c.data.keywords"> <ng-pluralize count="c.data.items.length" when="{'0': 'No items found for ', '1': 'One item matching ', 'other': 'Found {} items matching '}"> </ng-pluralize> {{c.data.keywords}} </div> </div> 

 This script provides a template to display the popular items returned from the server script. 

**4.** Refresh your test page preview to view the changes. 

 The widget displays popular items to the user prior to any search input. 

 Embed an existing widget 

 Enable the user to view and purchase Service Catalog items in the Quick Order widget by embedding the SC Catalog Item widget.

###### Before you begin 

 Role required: admin or sp_admin 

###### About this task 

 Instead of duplicating code, you can embed widgets to leverage pre-existing functionality. The SC Catalog Item widget is a base system widget that enables the user to view and purchase Service Catalog items. 

###### Procedure 

**1.** Inspect the SC Catalog Item widget.     Before embedding the SC Catalog Item widget, inspect the widget to understand what data     it needs access to. You may need to update your Quick Order widget client or server script to     make sure that the correct data is passed to the embedded widget. 

 a. Navigate to <yourInstanceURL>/sp_config?id=widget_editor. 

 b. Open the SC Catalog Item widget. 

 c. Note that the widget ID is widget-sc-cat-item. You will use this ID to embed the widget model in the client script. 

 d. Examine the server script. 

 Notice that the data object includes a sys_id property populated by either the input or options objects. If neither input nor options include a sys_id, the $sp.getParameter() method retrieves the sys_id from the request query string. 

 To populate the input object, you can pass a catalog item sys_id from the Quick Order widget client script. 

**2.** From the **Widget Editor** , open the Quick Order widget. 

**3.** Replace the Quick Order widget client script with the following script. 

© 2025 ServiceNow, Inc. All rights reserved. ServiceNow, the ServiceNow logo, Now, and other ServiceNow marks are trademarks and/or registered trademarks of ServiceNow, Inc., in the United States and/or other countries. 939 


 function ($location, spUtil) { var c = this ; 

 c.select = function (item_id) { if (c.openItem == item_id) { c.openItem = null; return ; } 

 renderCatalogItemWidget(item_id); } 

 function renderCatalogItemWidget(item_id) { c.catalogItemWidget = null; spUtil.get("widget-sc-cat-item", { sys_id: item_id }).then( function (response) { c.catalogItemWidget = response; c.openItem = item_id; }); } } 

 This script uses spUtil.get() to retrieve the widget model by ID (widget-sc-catitem) and define the {sys_id: item_id} object. This object posts to the server script as input. 

**4.** Replace the HTML template with the following script: 

 <div class="panel panel-primary"> <div class="panel-heading">Request an item from the catalog</div> <div class="panel-body"> <input class="form-control" type="search" placeholder="Start typing here to search the list of catalog items" ng-model="c.data.keywords" ng-change="c.server.update()" ng-model-options="{debounce: 250}" /> <h5 ng-if="!c.data.keywords">Showing the most popular items</h5> <ul class="list-group result-container"> <li class="list-group-item" ng-repeat="item in c.data.items"> <a href ng-click="c.select(item.sys_id)">{{item.name}}</a><span class="pull-right">{{item.price}}</span> <div class="catalog-item" ng-if="item.sys_id == c.openItem"> <sp-widget ng-if="c.catalogItemWidget" widget="c.catalogItemWidget" /> </div> </li> </ul> </div> <div class="panel-footer" ng-if="c.data.keywords"> <ng-pluralize count="c.data.items.length" 

© 2025 ServiceNow, Inc. All rights reserved. ServiceNow, the ServiceNow logo, Now, and other ServiceNow marks are trademarks and/or registered trademarks of ServiceNow, Inc., in the United States and/or other countries. 940 


 when="{'0': 'No items found for ', '1': 'One item matching ', 'other': 'Found {} items matching '}"> </ng-pluralize> {{c.data.keywords}} </div> </div> 

 This template: 

 ◦ Adds on-click behavior using the ng-click directive. 

 ◦ Displays the embedded SC Catalog Item widget using the sp-widget directive.

 Create a reusable directive and add it to a widget 

 Angular Providers are reusable components that can be added to multiple widgets. Using the Widget Angular Providers table, create a directive that shows a category icon next to each result in the Quick Order widget. 

###### Before you begin 

 Role required: admin or sp_admin 

###### About this task 

 Angular Providers let you build angular directives and services that can be injected into your client script controller. The code in a Provider differs from a typical Angular directive or service because it must be anonymous, without being appended to a specific module. 

###### Procedure 

**1.** Navigate to **All** > **Service Portal** > **Service Portal Configuration** > **Portal Tables** > **Widget**     **Angular Provider**.     The Widget Angular Providers table opens. 

**2.** Select **New** to create a new record. 

**3.** Fill out the form. 

 a. Add the type and name. 

 ▪ Type : Directive 

 ▪ Name : categoryIcon 

 b. Add the client script. 

 function () { return { template: '<span class="fa fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fa fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i><i class="fa fa-{{::icon}} fa-stack-1x fa-inverse"></i></span>', restrict: 'E', replace: true, scope: { category: '=' }, link: function (scope, element) { 

 var _iconMap = { "b06546f23731300054b6a3549dbe5dd8": "tablet", /* Tablets */ "15706fc0a0a0aa7007fc21e1ab70c2f": "question", /* Can we help you? */ "d68eb4d637b1300054b6a3549dbe5db2": "mobile-phone", /* Mobiles */ "109cdff8c6112276003b17991a09ad65": "print", /* Office and Print */ "5d643c6a3771300054b6a3549dbe5db0": "print", /* Printers */ "2c0b59874f7b4200086eeed18110c71f": "plug", /* Peripherals */ "2809952237b1300054b6a3549dbe5dd4": "desktop", /* Software */

 The widget HTML template, client script, and server script display in the widget editor. Basic script templates are included as a guide. 

##### Note: For server-side scripts, you can turn on using the ECMAScript 2021 (ES12) 

 JavaScript mode if your application uses ES5 Standards mode or Compatibility mode. Scripts in applications with the JavaScript mode set to ECMAScript 2021 (ES12) use ECMAScript 2021 (ES12) by default. For more information, see Turn on ECMAScript 2021 (ES12) mode for a script. 

 Widget option schema 

 Widget instances allow users to uniquely configure each widget they add to a page. Use the option schema to define the parameters for your widget. 

##### Storing instance options 

 When developing a widget, you can edit the option schema to create parameters for your widget, or you can create a table to store instance options. If you edit the existing option schema, any instance options defined are stored in JSON format in the Additional options, JSON format field in the sp_instance table. The following field types are available: 

**-** String 

**-** Boolean 

**-** Integer 

**-** Reference 

**-** Choice 

**-** Field_list (depends on table) 

**-** Field_name (depends on table) 

**-** Glide_list 

 To use other field types not supported in the option schema, create an extension table to store your custom widget option schema. Using a table enables you to: 

**-** Add any ServiceNow field type, including fields with advanced customization, to the option     schema. 

**-** Define a complex option schema. 

**-** Search and filter instance options. 

© 2025 ServiceNow, Inc. All rights reserved. ServiceNow, the ServiceNow logo, Now, and other ServiceNow marks are trademarks and/or registered trademarks of ServiceNow, Inc., in the United States and/or other countries. 947 


##### Note: While storing options in a table enables you to define more complex options, this 

 method is more difficult to maintain than editing the option schema. To avoid creating unnecessary tables and adding additional server calls to your widget, edit the existing option schema when possible. Store options in a table only when complex or searchable options are required. 

##### Using options in a widget 

 Access options in the widget from both the client script and the server script using the options global variable. You can access to any option value in your widget client script or server script using options.optionName. 

 Client script 

 function() { /* widget controller */ var c = this; console.log(c.options.text_color) //Outputs the text_color option for this instance } 

 Server script 

 (function() { $sp.log(options.text_color) //Logs the value of the text_color option to the browser console. })(); 

##### Defining default options 

 Before an option value is set on an instance, it appears as an undefined value when you access that option variable. Use the widget server script to specify default values for your options. 

 (function() { options.text_color=options.text_color||"blue"; options.maximum_entry_count=options.maximum_entry_count||5; }) 

 Edit the widget option schema 

 Widget instances allow users to uniquely configure each widget they add to a page. Edit the option schema to define basic parameters for your widget. 

###### Before you begin 

 You must have cloned or created a new widget. 

 Role required: admin or sp_admin 

###### Procedure 

**1.** Navigate to **All** > **Service Portal** > **Service Portal Configuration** > **Widget Editor**. 

**2.** Select the widget you want to configure the option schema for. 

**3.** Click the menu icon ( ) and select **Edit option schema**.     This option only appears for users that have the right to edit the widget. 

**4.** Click **+** to add a widget option. 

**5.** Define a label, name, type, hint and form section. 

© 2025 ServiceNow, Inc. All rights reserved. ServiceNow, the ServiceNow logo, Now, and other ServiceNow marks are trademarks and/or registered trademarks of ServiceNow, Inc., in the United States and/or other countries. 948 


 More fields appear depending on the type you select. 

 Adding flexible widget options allows you to create more reusable widgets. You can add default values to help users understand each widget option. If you do not select a form section, the default is set to Other options. 

**6.** Click **Save**.     The option schema you defined is stored in JSON format in the **Option schema** field in     the sp_widget table. Based on this option schema, each instance of the widget can use     individually defined instance options. 

**7.** Test the option schema by adding the widget to a page in the Service Portal Designer. 

 a. Navigate to Service Portal > Service Portal Configuration > Service Portal Designer. 

 b. Add the widget to a page and click the edit icon on the widget instance to view the instance options. 

 c. Configure the widget instance options. 

 d. View the configuration by navigating to the instance record in the sp_instance table. The instance options are stored in JSON format in the Additional options, JSON format field. 

 Store instance options in a table 

 Create a table to store widget instance options instead of editing the existing option schema. When using a table as your widget option schema, you can define custom fields using any ServiceNow field type, add filters to fields, and search or query instance options.

###### About this task 

 To define a custom option schema, add fields to an sp_instance extension table, then set your widget to use the extension table as a data source. Using an extension table enables you to: 

**-** Add any ServiceNow field type, including fields with advanced customization, to the option     schema. 

**-** Define complex widget options. 

**-** Search and filter instance options. 

##### Note: While storing options in a table enables you to define more complex options, this 

 method is more difficult to maintain than editing the option schema. To avoid creating unnecessary tables and adding additional server calls to your widget, edit the existing option schema when possible. Store options in a table only when complex or searchable options are required. 

###### Procedure 

**1.** Create a table that extends an sp_instance table to store your custom option schema. 

 a. Navigate to System Definition > Tables. 

 b. Click New. 

 c. Define a label and name. 

 d. In the Extends table field, select an sp_instance table that provides the necessary fields. 

 Instance table Description 

 Instance [sp_instance] Includes base instance fields. 

 Instance with Table [sp_instance_table] Includes sp_instance fields and fields to display table data such as Table and Filter. 

 e. Save the form. 

**2.** Define custom fields in the extension table.     You can define any field type to use in your option schema by adding new columns in the     **Columns** list. 

**3.** Update your widget to use the extension table as a data source. 

 a. Navigate to Service Portal > Widgets. 

 b. Open the widget you would like to create custom options for.

 Reuse components with Angular Providers 

 Angular Providers are reusable components that can be injected into multiple widgets. To ensure quick loading widgets and a high performing portal, create Angular Providers instead of overloading your client controllers with persistent data and additional logic. With Angular Providers, you can maintain data for the lifetime of your Service Portal and reuse components and data objects across multiple widgets. 

###### Before you begin 

 Role required: admin or sp_admin 

###### About this task 

 By creating an Angular Provider, you can: 

**-** Keep widgets in sync when changing records or filters. 

**-** Share context between widgets. 

**-** Maintain and persist state. 

**-** Create behaviors and inject them into multiple widgets. 

 To learn more, visit Angular Providers. 

##### Tip: For easier maintenance and troubleshooting, remove any unused providers from the 

 Angular Providers related list in the Widget [sp_widget] table.

###### Procedure 

**1.** Navigate to **All** > **Service Portal** > **Service Portal Configuration** > **Portal Tables** > **Widget**     **Angular Provider**.     The Widget Angular Providers table opens. 

**2.** Click **New** to create a new record. 

**3.** Select the type of Angular Provider. 

 ◦ Directive 

 ◦ Factory 

 ◦ Service To facilitate migration to ECMAScript 6 or later, consider using services over factories. 

**4.** Define a name.     You will use the name to associate the Provider with your widget. 

**5.** Add a script in the **Client Script** field. 

 Example 

 A basic factory that formats a number in US currency. 

 function formatterFactory(){ var myVal = Number; return { format: function(myVal) { return '$' + myVal.toFixed(2); } } } 

**6.** Associate the Angular Provider with a widget. 

 a. Navigate to <yourInstanceURL>/sp_config?id=widget_edit. 

 b. Open the widget you would like to associate with the Angular Provider. 

 c. Under Related Lists , select Angular Providers. 

 d. In the Angular Providers list, click New. 

 e. In the Angular Provider field, select the appropriate Provider. 

 f. Check the Widget field to ensure that you are associating the Angular Provider with the correct widget. 

 g. Click Save. 

**7.** Update the appropriate scripts in your widget to inject the Angular Provider into the widget. 

 Example 

 Inject the factory into your widget client script by passing the name of the factory as an argument in your client controller function. You can then access the object defined in the factory function in your widget client script. 

 function(formatterFactory) { /* widget controller */ var c = this; console.log(formatterFactory.format(300)); }

 If defining a directive, use the directive in the widget HTML template. 

**8.** To edit the Angular Provider after it is registered with your widget, open the Angular Provider     client script in the widget editor. 

 a. Navigate to Service Portal Configuration > Widget Editor. 

 b. Under Edit an existing widget , select the widget associated with your Angular Provider. 

 c. From the Show menu, open the Dependencies list and select the Angular Provider. 

##### Note: Only Angular Providers associated with the widget are displayed in the 

 Dependencies list. This list includes any external resources your widget depends on. 

 The Angular Provider client script displays in the widget editor. In the widget editor interface, you can edit and save your widget and Provider scripts at the same time. 

###### What to do next 

 To use an Angular Provider with multiple widgets, register your Provider with each widget and update the appropriate scripts. 

 Embedded widgets 

 Embed a widget in the HTML template, server script, or client script. 

##### Embed a widget in an HTML template 

 Use the <widget></widget> element to embed a widget in an HTML template. Pass in the ID of the widget you are trying to embed as a parameter. 

 <div> <widget id="widget-cool-clock"></widget> </div> 

 If a widget has an option schema, you can define instance options in JSON format. 

 <widget id="widget-cool-clock" options='{"zone": "America/Los_Angeles","title": "San Diego, CA"}'></widget> 

 Alternatively, you can define options in the widget server script. 

 HTML template 

 <widget id="widget-cool-clock" options='data.clockOptions'></widget> 

 Server script 

 (function() { data.clockOptions = {"zone": "America/Los_Angeles","title": "San Diego, CA"}; })(); 

##### Embed a widget in a client script 

 Use spUtil.get() to get a widget model in the client script. 

 spUtil.get("widget-sc-cat-item", {sys_id: "your_catalog_item_sys_id"}).then(function(response) { 

© 2025 ServiceNow, Inc. All rights reserved. ServiceNow, the ServiceNow logo, Now, and other ServiceNow marks are trademarks and/or registered trademarks of ServiceNow, Inc., in the United States and/or other countries. 955 


 c.catalogItemWidget = response; }); 

###### When using the spUtil class in a widget client script, you must inject the class into the client 

 script function. The following example embeds the Cool Clock widget: 

 Client script 

 function(spUtil) { var c = this; 

 spUtil.get("widget-cool-clock").then(function(respon se) { c.myClockWidget = response; }); } 

 HTML template 

 <sp-widget widget="c.myClockWidget"></sp-widget> 

##### Embed a widget in a server script 

 Use $sp.getWidget() to get a widget model in the server script. 

 data.catalogItemWidget = $sp.getWidget("widget-sc-cat-item"); 

 The following example embeds the Cool Clock widget: 

 Server script 

 (function() { var coolClockOptions = {"zone": "America/Los_Angeles","title": "San Diego, CA"} data.coolClockWidget = $sp.getWidget('widget-cool-clock', coolClockOptions); })(); 

 HTML template 

 <sp-widget widget="data.coolClockWidget"></sp-widget> 

##### Widget model properties 

 When a widget model is called from within another widget, the HTML template, client script, and link function are loaded just as they are in the sp_widget record. The data property is the result of the widget server script execution. Anything that you put on the data object on the server is available in the data object on the client. 

 Property name Type Description 

 client_script string Widget client script field. 

 css string Compiled CSS output from the SASS field for the widget. 

 data object Data object containing keys and values from the widget server script. 

 dependencies array Any third-party libraries to load before the widget executes.

 Create a widget dependency 

 In Service Portal, you can link JavaScript and CSS files to widgets to create dependencies between widgets and third-party libraries, external style sheets, and angular modules. 

###### Before you begin 

 Role required: sp_admin or admin 

###### About this task 

 Dependencies are loaded asynchronously from the server when needed.

 Widgets can have as many or as few dependencies as needed. However, the more you add, the more content a widget must download to render on the page. Keep dependencies as small as possible for more efficient load times. 

###### Procedure 

**1.** Create a dependency package. 

 A dependency package is a collection of JavaScript and CSS files that can be connected to a widget. 

 a. Navigate to Service Portal > Dependencies. 

 b. In the dependency record, define the following fields. 

 Field Description 

 Name The name of your dependency. (Useful for selecting a dependency from a dropdown list.) 

 Application Application scope for the dependency record. 

 Include on page load Select if you want your dependency to be loaded onto the page on the initial page load of Service Portal, or leave unchecked to load the dependency only when the linked widget is loaded onto a page. 

 Angular module name Optional. Define the value if the linked JavaScript is an Angular module. Provide the name of the Angular module being loaded, so that it can be injected into the Service Portal Angular application. 

**2.** Add files to the dependency package. 

 After you save the information for your dependency package, use the related lists to add JS and CSS Include files. For each related list, include the following information: 

 Field Description 

 Display name Name of the script include.

 Include a font icon in a single widget 

 If you only want one widget to have access to a font icon, include the font icon in a single widget. 

###### Before you begin 

 Role required: admin or sp_admin 

###### About this task 

 Adding an icon to a specific widget keeps the icon scoped and prevents it from interfering with other CSS on the page. 

###### Procedure 

**1.** In the platform UI, navigate to **Service Portal** > **Widgets** , then click the widget you want to add     an icon to. 

**2.** Attach the individual icon file to the widget record. 

**3.** In the HTML template, include something like the following: 

 <div> <i class='font-family'>icon_name</i> you did it! </div> 

 Make sure that the class is exactly the same as the font family called out in the CSS. For example, <i class='material-icons'> should be the same as the .materialicons included in the CSS. The icon_name should match the name of the file you attached. 

**4.** In the CSS field for the widget, add the CSS for the font-icon definition. 

 Most font-icon sets include a CSS file similar to the material icons one used below. Use the sys_id of the attachment as the src in the CSS. For example: 

 /* fallback */ @font-face { font-family : 'Material Icons'; font-style : normal; font-weight : 400 ; src: url('/828b8ca8b7033010897725cbde11a9f7.iix') format('woff2'); } 

 .material-icons { font-family : 'Material Icons'; font-weight : normal; font-style : normal; font-size : 24 px; /* Preferred icon size */ display : inline-block; line-height : 1 ; text-transform : none;

**3.** Navigate to **Service Portal** > **Dependencies** and create a new dependency. 

**4.** Attach the CSS record you created to the new dependency using the **CSS Includes** related list. 

 Internationalize a widget 

 Use the ${} or gs.getMessage() syntax in the HTML Template , Client Script , or Server Script fields of a widget to tag strings for translation so you can localize your Service Portal content. 

 The ${} or gs.getMessage() searches in the messages table [sys_ui_message] in the platform to see what the translation would be. 

 Use the HTML template to internationalize strings in a widget. Type the following in an HTML template. 

 <div> <p>${This message will be internationalized.}</p> <p>However, this will NOT be.</p> </div> 

 Writing text as ${message} is the equivalent of writing ${gs.getMessage("message")} in other parts of the system, but written as a more legible shorthand. 

##### Note: In some cases, the translation might have quotes or double quotes on it. That could 

 lead to JavaScript errors if you are using the ${} syntax in the client script. The safest way to fetch a translated message is to do it in the server script. Then, assign the value to a clientside Angular binding.

##### Translating strings in the client script 

 function() { var c =this; c.message="${This message will be internationalized}"; } 

 HTML template: 

 <div> <!-The output of this text will be internationalized. --> <p>{{c.message}}</p> </div> 

##### Translating strings in the server script 

 Use the server script to translate schema options and other values during server-side runtime. 

 Server script 

 function() { data.message=gs.getMessage("this message contains 'quotes'"); //You can also translate schema options using the server script //For example, data.message=gs.getMessage(options.title); } 

 HTML template 

 <div> <p>{{c.data.message}}</p> </div> 

 Replace a Service Catalog form script with a widget 

 You can use widgets in Service Portal to replace UI Macros. If your Service Catalog form includes a UI Macro that references other fields or variables on the form, you can create a widget to hold reusable code and embed it within the Service Catalog form. Use special syntax to access any variable fields on the form. 

###### Before you begin 

 Role required: admin or sp_admin 

###### Procedure 

**1.** Create a widget that performs the action you would like to use in catalog item forms.     See step 7 for a simple example widget that accesses another variable on the form. 

**2.** Open a catalog item that previously used a UI Macro or other reusable component not     supported in Service Portal. 

**3.** In related lists, add a new variable to the catalog item. 

**4.** Configure the variable form to add the **Widget** field. 

**5.** In the **Type** field, select **Macro**. 

**6.** In the **Widget** field, select a widget that performs the desired action. 

**7. Optional:** Use the $scope.page.g_form() or $scope.page.field syntax in the     embedded widget to access the catalog item values. 

© 2025 ServiceNow, Inc. All rights reserved. ServiceNow, the ServiceNow logo, Now, and other ServiceNow marks are trademarks and/or registered trademarks of ServiceNow, Inc., in the United States and/or other countries. 963 


 Example This example shows how to modify the value of a single-line text variable with the name color associated with the catalog item. 

 Widget HTML Template 

 <div> Data from catalog variable: <h1>{{ c.data.message }}</h1> </div> 

 Widget client script 

 function($scope) { var c = this; 

 //Watch for changes in the color variable $scope.$watch(function () { return $scope.page.g_form.getValue('color'); }, function (value) { //Update local data object with data from variable c.data.message = value? 'Content of color variable: ' + value : ''; }); } 

 You can use the following to access variable or catalog item fields: 

 ◦ $scope.page.g_form(): The g_form instance on the form. You can use all supported g_form methods described in Service Portal and client scripts. For example, g_form.setValue('variable_name', 'new value');. 

 ◦ $scope.page.field(): The object that represents the variable. When you open the catalog item in the Service Portal, the embedded widget accesses the variable fields associated with the catalog item. 

 Widget troubleshooting guide

 to false on a widget record to hide the widget on the page, and prevent associated scripts from executing. 

 Use the browser developer console 

 All supported desktop browsers have built in developer tools. Access your browsers developer tools to view console messages and errors thrown by client-side JavaScript. Many of the logging tools detailed below output information to this console. 

 If you experience performance issues, check the JavaScript console to see if there are errors, a large number of HTTP requests, or HTTP requests that take a long time to resolve. You can use the console to identify any widgets that load slowly. For more information, see the How to identify a slow widget on a page [KB0744521] article in the Now Support Knowledge Base. 

 Determine the cause of performance issues 

 The following tips can help determine the cause of performance issues in portals: 

**-** Determine if the issue is related to the portal or platform-wide by comparing the     functionality in both interfaces. For more information about platform performance     issues, see Platform performance. 

**-** Determine if the issue affects the entire portal or specific pages. If all pages in     the portal are slow, check if scripted menu items in the header menu or themes     with large font or image files could be the cause. If a specific page is slow, use the     browser developer console to determine which widget could be the cause. 

**-** Check the Log [syslog] table for warnings related to large JSON objects causing     slowness. If these warnings are appear with the action that causes slowness, this     indicates that a widget is using too much data. 

 For more information, see the Six common performance pitfalls in Service Portal and how to avoid them [KB0634588] article in the Now Support Knowledge Base. 

 Use the widget context menu to access information and options 

 CTRL+right-click a widget to access configuration options for the widget. There are also options to output the scope and scope data object to the browser console. For more detail on this menu, see Using portal widgets. 

 Use script methods to capture debugging output 

 Several methods are available to output debugging information within your server and client-side code. 

 Scripted debugging methods 

 Method Availability Description 

 console.log() Server and client 

 Logs output to the browser developer console. 

 $sp.log() Server Logs output to the Service Portal Log Entries [sp_log] table, when the logged in user has the sp_admin or admin role. 

 gs.log() Server^ Logs output to the Log [syslog] table.

 Scripted debugging methods (continued) 

 Method Availability Description 

##### Note: gs.log creates records on 

 the syslog table. Excessive use can adversely affect performance. 

 gs.warn() Server Produces warning level output in the Log [syslog] table. 

 gs.error() Server Produces error level output in the Log [syslog] table. 

 gs.addInfoMessage() Server Displays a green information message at the top of the browser window. 

 gs.addErrorMessage() Server Displays a red error message at the top of the browser window. 

 spUtil.addErrorMessage() Client Displays an error message within the browser window. 

 spUtil.addInfoMessage() Client Displays an Info message within the browser window. 

 spUtil.addTrivialMessage() Client Displays a message which automatically disappears after a short time. 

 debugger Client Sets a break point in Chrome and Firefox browsers, allowing you to step through a script line by line in the browsers developer console. 

 {{data|json}} HTML This code can be added to the HTML code of a page to output the data object to the portal page in JSON format. 

 Check for security restrictions 

 Often, widget display issues are caused by access rules or user criteria rather than the widget script. Check the user criteria for records and verify that any records that are not accessible within a widget are accessible using the platform UI. Use the ACL debugger to ensure that your users have the expected access to records used by your widgets. For more detail on the debugger, see ACL debugging tools. 

 Service Catalog items can also be restricted to not appear in Service Portal. If you get a You are either not authorized or record is not valid error message for a Service Catalog widget, check that the item is not hidden from Service Portal. 

 Check the associated Angular Providers 

 Verify that the necessary Angular Providers are associated with widgets. Removing the default Angular Providers associated with a base system widget can cause unexpected behavior. For example, removing the scToggleData or scBindHtmlCompile Angular Providers from the SC Catalog Item widget. 

 Create a reference to the widgets scope in the console 

© 2025 ServiceNow, Inc. All rights reserved. ServiceNow, the ServiceNow logo, Now, and other ServiceNow marks are trademarks and/or registered trademarks of ServiceNow, Inc., in the United States and/or other countries. 966 


 Use reference to a widget to manipulate scope data or manually run the widgets client and server scripts. Use the following steps to create the reference. 

**-** 1. Right-click the widget and choose **Inspect**. 

**-** 2. In dev tools Elements tab, click to highlight the element with attribute     widget=widget. You can find it a few elements above the currently inspected     element. This element points the $0 scripting tool at the widget. 

**-** In the Javascript console, run the following code: 

 var scopeRef = angular.element($0).scope(); 

 Use the reference to your widget to change data within the console. See the following example. Remember to run AngularJS $apply() on the scope to apply changes to the page. 

 scopeRef.data.prop1 = "Pear"; scopeRef.$apply(); 

 Run any function defined in the widgets client controller from your reference using the syntax below. 

 scopeRef.exampleFunction(); 

 Use the refresh command to manually execute the widgets server script. 

 scopeRef.server.refresh(); 

 Widget diagnostics 

 Resolve Service Portal page issues by identifying widget customization levels and checking widget code directly from a portal page. 

 If a portal page isn't working as expected, it may be because of a bug in widget code. To diagnose the page, try diagnosing the widgets on the page. 

 Diagnosing widgets involves: 

**-** Identifying widget customization levels 

**-** Checking the code that is used in each widget 

##### Identifying customization levels 

 Customization levels describe how widgets have been modified or developed. Identifying the customization level of a widget can help you know which part of the widget code is most important to check. There are four levels of widget customization. 

 Customization level Description 

 Base Base widget installed on a base system or with other ServiceNow plugins. Base widgets have no modifications but can have widget instances for which you have set instance options. 

 Cloned Widget that you cloned from a base widget. 

 New Widget that you created. 

 Customized Base widget that you configured in any of the following ways: 

© 2025 ServiceNow, Inc. All rights reserved. ServiceNow, the ServiceNow logo, Now, and other ServiceNow marks are trademarks and/or registered trademarks of ServiceNow, Inc., in the United States and/or other countries. 967 


 Customization level Description 

**-** Modified the widget code directly 

**-** Modified widget option schema 

**-** Modified widget dependencies, ng-templates, or Angular Providers 

 To identify the customization levels of widgets on a portal page, open the Widget Context Menu and select Show Widget Customizations. Widgets are color-coded as follows: 

**-** Green: base widget 

**-** Yellow: cloned widget 

**-** Blue: new widget 

**-** Red: customized widget

 Widget customizations highlighted on a portal page 

##### Checking the widget code 

 After you've identified the customization levels of widgets on a portal page, check the code in each widget. 

 To view the widget code from the portal page, click the information icon ( ) on a widget. 

© 2025 ServiceNow, Inc. All rights reserved. ServiceNow, the ServiceNow logo, Now, and other ServiceNow marks are trademarks and/or registered trademarks of ServiceNow, Inc., in the United States and/or other countries. 969 


 From the widget diagnostics window, you can check the widget code in several ways: 

**-** View a widget record from a portal page 

 View and identify potentially problematic code in the widget record without navigating away from the portal page. 

**-** Identify customizations in widget related records 

 View and identify potentially problematic code in the widget dependencies, Angular Providers, and ng-templates that are being used by the widget. 

**-** Compare versions of a widget related record 

 Compare an Angular Provider or ng-template against its previous version so that you check if your most recent code changes are causing issues on a portal page. 

**-** Compare versions of a customized widget 

 Compare your most recent update of a customized widget against the previous version to check if your recent changes are causing issues on a portal page. 

**-** Compare a cloned or customized widget against a base widget 

 Identify customizations to a widget so that you can revert your cloned or customized widgets and resolve issues on a portal page. 

© 2025 ServiceNow, Inc. All rights reserved. ServiceNow, the ServiceNow logo, Now, and other ServiceNow marks are trademarks and/or registered trademarks of ServiceNow, Inc., in the United States and/or other countries. 970 


##### Recommendations for diagnosing widgets 

 Of the four customization levels, the highest priority issue is customized widgets. These widgets aren't supported in system upgrades. If you're experiencing page issues during an upgrade, it may be because you have a customized widget on your portal page. 

 To resolve page issues that may be caused by customized widgets, identify which parts of the widget code have been customized. Then revert the code to the original configuration. For more information on identifying these code differences, see Compare a cloned or customized widget against a base widget. 

##### Tip: Even if a customized widget is not causing page issues now, you may want to revert to 

 the original widget to prevent issues during upgrades later. 

 If you're still experiencing page issues after reverting customized widgets, check your new and cloned widgets next. 

 With a new widget, it's likely that your most recent code changes are causing issues on your portal page. To identify your most recent changes so that you can debug your code, follow the steps in Compare versions of a widget related record. 

 If you cloned a widget prior to a system upgrade, it's likely that the cloned widget didn't receive the same updated code as the base widget. In this case, it's recommended that you clone the widget again and add your customizations to the clone. 

 A base widget is least likely to cause page issues. If you've already checked other widgets and are still experiencing page issues, remove base widgets from the page and add them again without any widget options set. You can also try adding base widgets to another page instead. 

##### Limitations 

 There are several known limitations using widget diagnostics from a portal page: 

**-** Although you can view and compare widget code, you can't fix or revert code directly. Navigate     away from the portal to change the code. 

**-** If you navigate to another portal page while using widget diagnostics, the system disables the     tool. 

**-** Because the tool uses color to categorize widgets, it may not be accessible for visually     impaired users. 

**-** The widget dependencies that are listed on the portal page reflect only the first-level     dependencies. Any dependency that is nested deeper than the first level is not included. To     further troubleshoot the widget, check the nested dependencies in the widget record. 

**-** There is no way for the system to track a Widget Dependency after you've deleted it.

##### Improving search engine optimization for portals 

 Search engine optimization (SEO) helps portal users find the information they need and be more engaged with your portal. Adding SEO information to your public portal pages improves how external search engines index and rank pages to make them more findable. 

 You can add the following types of information to Service Portal pages to improve SEO:

**-** Human readable keywords in URLs. 

**-** Meta tags that include information about the page or portal in the <head> section of a page. 

**-** Dynamic page titles that are descriptive of the page contents. 

**-** hreflang tags that specify all the available languages of a page. 

**-** Canonical URLs that specify which pages to index from sets of duplicate URLs. 

 To improve SEO for your portal further, you can also define and automatically generate XML sitemaps for search engines to index using the Sitemap Generator application. 

 Some portal pages load data from a record that's specified by a parameter in the URL. For these pages, you can use dynamic page variables to add meta tags, page titles, and human readable URL keywords that vary depending on the record loaded in the page. 

 Using a Service Catalog page as an example, the following URL includes a sys_id parameter in addition to the page ID. Different content loads on the page depending on the value of the sys_id parameter, which specifies a catalog item record. 

 https://<instance>/sp? id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=c3b9cbf29716cd1021983d1e6253afad 

 In this example, the sys_id is for the iPad pro catalog item. The sc_cat_item page has been configured to generate a dynamic title and dynamic keywords in the URL based on the Name field of the catalog item record. 

 Add human readable keywords to page URLs 

 Add human readable keywords to the URLs of portal pages to improve search engine optimization (SEO) and click-through rates and help users understand what to expect on the page. 

###### Before you begin 

 Role required: sp_admin or admin 

###### About this task 

 Human readable keywords are added to URLs in the following format: 

© 2025 ServiceNow, Inc. All rights reserved. ServiceNow, the ServiceNow logo, Now, and other ServiceNow marks are trademarks and/or registered trademarks of ServiceNow, Inc., in the United States and/or other countries. 982 


 https://<instance>/<portal suffix>/<guest language>/<keywords>? id=<page id>&<page parameters> 

 Keywords can be populated using static content or dynamic page variables and can include a single slash (/). Dynamic page variables load keywords that are based on data in a record. The page parameters in the URL specify which record to use. In the following examples, the category and short description of a knowledge article and the category and name of a catalog item are added as keywords: 

**-** https://<instance>/kb/en/faq/what-is-a-cookie?     id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0000007 

**-** https://<instance>/sp/es/hardware/developer-laptop-mac?     id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=774906834fbb4200086eeed18110c737 

##### Note: To turn off human readable URLs for an instance, add the 

###### glide.service_portal.enable_human_readable_urls property to the 

 System Properties [sys_properties] table and set the value to false. 

###### Procedure 

**1.** Navigate to **All** > **Service Portal** > **Pages**. 

**2.** Select a page. 

**3. Optional:** Use keywords that are dynamic based on the page content by adding a dynamic     page variable to the page. 

 a. Select the Dynamic page variables related list tab. 

 b. Select New. 

 c. On the form, fill in the fields. 

 Dynamic page variables form 

 Field Description 

 Name The variable that loads keywords in the page URL from record data. The variable name must begin with % and can’t contain spaces. For example, %short_descr. 

 Order The priority order from lowest to highest for when multiple dynamic page variables with the same name have different URL query parameters. 

 Page The page that uses the dynamic page variable to include keywords in the URL. 

 URL query parameter The parameter in the page URL that determines which record displays. 

 Relevant table column The column in the specified table that includes the values of the URL query parameter. The default value is Sys ID. 

 Table The table that includes the records used to populate keywords in the URL and the column with the values of the URL query parameter. 

 Table field A field from records in the specified table that populates the keywords in the URL. 

© 2025 ServiceNow, Inc. All rights reserved. ServiceNow, the ServiceNow logo, Now, and other ServiceNow marks are trademarks and/or registered trademarks of ServiceNow, Inc., in the United States and/or other countries. 983 


 Field Description 

 Query condition Conditions that filter the records in the table. A record must meet the query conditions for the variable to apply. 

 Example 

 (Optional) This example shows the values for a variable that references the short description of a knowledge base article identified by its number for a published workflow. 

 Dynamic page variable 

 Field Value 

 Name %short_descr 

 Page kb_article_view 

 Order 100 

 URL query parameter sysparm_article 

 Relevant table column Number 

 Table Knowledge[kb_knowledge] 

 Table field Short description 

 Query condition [Workflow][is][Published] 

**4.** Select **Submit**. 

**5.** In the **Human readable url structure** field of the page record, specify the keywords to populate     in the page URL using static content, dynamic page variables, or a combination. 

 Keywords can include alphanumeric characters, hyphens (‐), one slash (/), and percent signs (%) for variables. 

 Example 

 Human readable url structure Example value 

 Static content faq/what-is-a-cookie 

 Dynamic page variables %category/%short_descr 

 Static content and dynamic page variable 

 faq/%short_descr 

 Keywords are automatically formatted to use only lowercase letters, replace spaces with hyphens, and remove any disallowed special characters added by dynamic page variables. If the keywords in the URL exceed 75 characters, they’re truncated to be less than or equal to 75 characters. 

**6.** Select **Update**. 

###### Result 

 If users access the page using the URL without human readable keywords, the page URL is updated in one of the following ways: 

© 2025 ServiceNow, Inc. All rights reserved. ServiceNow, the ServiceNow logo, Now, and other ServiceNow marks are trademarks and/or registered trademarks of ServiceNow, Inc., in the United States and/or other countries. 984 


**-** On the initial page load by a guest user, the page redirects to the human readable URL. 

**-** On the initial page load by an authenticated user, the URL is updated to include the human     readable keywords without redirection. 

**-** On subsequent page loads for all users, the URL is updated to include the human readable     keywords without redirection. 

##### Example: Knowledge article page with human readable keywords in the URL 

 In this example, the kb_article_view page displays knowledge article KB0000007. The knowledge article record has the following fields and values: 

**- Category** is **FAQ** 

**- Short description** is What is a cookie? 

 The page has been configured to add keywords based on these field values to the URL using dynamic page variables such as %category/%short_descr. The question mark in the short description isn’t an allowed character in the URL keywords so it’s automatically removed from the URL. The question mark that is in the URL is the query parameter that's always included before the page ID. 

 The URL that is displayed in the browser appears as: http://<instance>.com/kb/en/ faq/what-is-a-cookie?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0000007. 

###### What to do next 

 For pages that have canonical URLs, you must include the human readable keywords in the canonical URL. In the SEO script include that returns canonical URLs for pages, use one of 

###### the getHumanReadableUrl methods in the SPSEOUtilsSNC class to return the human 

 readable keywords in page URLs and include them in the canonical URLs. 

 For more information about including human readable keywords in canonical URLs, refer to the following resources: 

**-** Configure custom SEO tags for canonical URLs and localized knowledge articles 

**-** SPSEOUtilsSNC - Global

© 2025 ServiceNow, Inc. All rights reserved. ServiceNow, the ServiceNow logo, Now, and other ServiceNow marks are trademarks and/or registered trademarks of ServiceNow, Inc., in the United States and/or other countries. 992 


 You can also activate Sitemap Generator from the ServiceNow Store. Visit the ServiceNow Store website to view all the available apps and for information about submitting requests to the store. For cumulative release notes information for all released apps, see the ServiceNow Store version history release notes. 

##### Sitemap requirements 

 The sitemap is generated from a script or static XML. When creating a sitemap, you must ensure that its contents meet the following requirements because validating them isn’t handled automatically: 

**-** Includes only pages with unauthenticated user access. 

 Sitemap Generator automatically excludes portal URLs that aren’t publicly accessible from sitemaps. However, this doesn’t apply for URLs with custom domains instead of the ServiceNow domain. URLs that are excluded from the sitemap are listed in the Application Log [syslog_app_scope] table. 

**-** Excludes pages that respond with a 301 redirect. 

**-** Excludes pages with the NOINDEX meta tag, such as retired or expired pages. If you use a     script to create the sitemap, include logic similar to that of the SEO script include you used     to add NOINDEX meta tags to pages to exclude those pages from the sitemap. For more     information, see Configure custom SEO tags for canonical URLs and localized knowledge     articles. 

**-** For any pages with canonical URLs or hreflang tags, the sitemap includes those canonical 

###### URLs or URLs with hreflang tags returned by the SEO script include for that page. If you 

 use a script to create the sitemap, include logic similar to that of the SEO script include you 

###### used to return canonical URLs or URLs with hreflang tags. For more information, see SEO 

 for canonical URLs and localized versions of knowledge articles. 

**-** For any pages with human readable keywords in URLS, the sitemap includes those URLs     with human readable keywords. If you use a script to create the sitemap, use one of the 

###### getHumanReadableUrl methods in the SPSEOUtilsSNC class to return the human 

 readable keywords and include them in the sitemap URLs. For more information, see Add human readable keywords to page URLs. 

##### Note: Guidance on how to meet these requirements is included in the code templates 

 in the Script and Static XML fields where the sitemap contents are defined. For more information, see Generate XML sitemaps for SEO indexing. 

 For more information about sitemap requirements for SEO, refer to the following resources: 

**-** Build and submit a sitemap in the Google documentation 

**-** XML schema for the Sitemap protocol on the sitemaps.org website

 Service Portal SCSS Primer 

 SCSS is a subset of the Syntactically Awesome StyleSheets (Sass) specification and is an extension of CSS. Every valid CSS style sheet is valid SCSS. 

© 2025 ServiceNow, Inc. All rights reserved. ServiceNow, the ServiceNow logo, Now, and other ServiceNow marks are trademarks and/or registered trademarks of ServiceNow, Inc., in the United States and/or other countries. 1016 


 SCSS variables 

 SCSS variables are a way to store information that you want to reuse throughout your style sheet. You can store things like colors, font stacks, or any CSS value you think you want to reuse. SCSS uses the $ symbol to make something a variable. 

 SCSS supports the follow data types: 

**-** Numbers (including units) 

**-** Strings (with quotes or without) 

**-** Colors (name, or names) 

**-** Booleans 

 Variables can also be arguments to or results from one of several available functions or mixins. During translation, the values of the variables are inserted into the output CSS document. 

 For example: 

 $font-stack: Helvetica, sans-serif; $primary-color: #333; 

 body { font: 100%$font-stack; color: $primary-color; } 

 For more information on Sass, see the Sass/SCSS reference.

 SCSS nesting 

 SCSS lets you nest your CSS selectors in a way that follows the same visual hierarchy of your HTML. 

 For example: 

 nav { ul { margin: 0; padding: 0; list-style: none; } 

 li { display: inline-block; } 

 a { display: block; padding: 6px 12px; text-decoration: none; } } 

© 2025 ServiceNow, Inc. All rights reserved. ServiceNow, the ServiceNow logo, Now, and other ServiceNow marks are trademarks and/or registered trademarks of ServiceNow, Inc., in the United States and/or other countries. 1020 


 The ul, li, and a selectors are nested inside the nav selector, which is a great way to organize your CSS and make it more readable. When the widget is rendered, the generated CSS looks something like the following code block: 

 nav ul { margin: 0; padding: 0; list-style: none; } 

 nav li { display: inline-block; } 

 nav a { display: block; padding: 6px 12px; text-decoration: none; } 

 For more information on Sass, see the Sass/SCSS reference. 

 SCSS operators 

 SCSS has a handful of standard math operators like +, -, *, /, and %. 

 Use simple math to calculate widths for an aside & article. For example: 

 .container { width: 100%; } 

 article[role="main"] { float: left; width: 600px / 960px * 100%; } 

 aside[role="complementary"] { float: right; width: 300px / 960px * 100%; } 

 The generated CSS looks like: 

 .container { width: 100%; } 

 article[role="main"] { float: left; width: 62.5%; } 

 aside[role="complementary"] { float: right; width: 31.25%; } 

 For more information on Sass, see the Sass/SCSS reference.

 SCSS mixins 

 A mixin lets you make groups of CSS declarations that you want to reuse throughout your site. You can pass in values to make your mixin more flexible. 

 The following code block is an example for border-radius. 

 @mixin border-radius($radius) { -webkit-border-radius: $radius; -moz-border-radius: $radius; -ms-border-radius: $radius; border-radius: $radius; } 

 .box { @include border-radius(10px); } 

 The generated CSS looks like: 

 .box { -webkit-border-radius: 10px; -moz-border-radius: 10px; -ms-border-radius: 10px; border-radius: 10px; } 

 For more information on Sass, see the Sass/SCSS reference. 

 Domain separation and Service Portal 

 Domain separation is unsupported in Service Portal. Domain separation enables you to separate data, processes, and administrative tasks into logical groupings called domains. You can control several aspects of this separation, including which users can see and access data. 

##### Support level: No support 

**-** The domain field may exist on data tables but there is no business logic to manage the data. 

**-** This level is not considered domain-separated. 

 For more information on support levels, see Application support for domain separation. 

##### Overview 

 Domain separation provides complete data isolation for domain-specific users. 

##### How domain separation works in Service Portal 

 Elements of the Service Portal platform such as settings, portals, pages and widgets are not domain-separated. However, the data within widgets does display when based on the appropriate domain. To provide different experiences, admins should create separate service portals, each with unique URLs, that they can redirect users to.

 Exploring Embedded Help 

 Embedded help provides targeted help content to a user in a UI page, based on their role. Some embedded help content comes with the base instance. Your organization can add or replace embedded help content. 

##### Embedded Help overview 

 Embedded Help enables you to provide the help that your users need, as well as benefit from help topics available in the base system. You can add new embedded help content or replace content. Replacing content involves deactivating the existing topic and adding a topic. 

 Your organization may want to add or replace embedded help content for some of the following reasons: 

**-** To provide help for custom applications. 

**-** To provide more specific instructions or embedded videos to describe your business process. 

**-** To provide embedded help content where none exists for a page. 

**-** To provide embedded help content in languages other than English (default). 

**-** To provide different content for different roles. 

 The UI page name identifies embedded help content. To find the page name, look for the table name in the URL for that view. For example, the page name for the list view of Assessment Metric Types is asmt_metric_type_list and is found in this address: instancename.service-now.com/nav_to.do?uri= %2Fasmt_metric_type_list.do%3Fsysparm_userpref_module%. The page name for the form view is asmt_metric_type.

 You cannot edit the content in a base system topic. In base system topics, the read-only ServiceNow Help check box is selected. If you edit the content and try to save changes, you see an error message. To change the information that appears in a base system topic, make a copy of the topic, which clears the ServiceNow Help check box. Modify the topic with your content and save it. Customized content takes precedent over ServiceNow help content and is displayed when a user opens help for that UI page. 

 Starting this release, Embedded Help also supports non-English content import without overriding the last uploaded language content. 

##### Embedded Help workflow 

 The ServiceNow datacenter contains the Content Delivery Network (CDN) where embedded help content is stored. Topics in the local (instance) Embedded Help Content [sys_embedded_help_content] table are populated from the CDN. Help content in the CDN is refreshed every 30 days. 

 When a user accesses a UI page, the embedded help process displays a custom topic if one exists for the user's role. If there is no custom topic, the following steps are performed. 

**1.** Checks the browser cache first, and displays the content if found in the cache. It then checks     the Embedded Help Content [sys_embedded_help_content] table for the corresponding     embedded help topic with the role and qualifier, if applicable. 

 ◦ If a topic is found, it checks the date in the Last sync field. If the date is 15 or more days old, it places a request in the Embedded Help Queue [sys_embedded_help_queue] table with the last sync date and the resource ID. 

 ◦ If a topic is not found, it places a request in the Embedded Help Queue [sys_embedded_help_queue] table with the current date and the resource ID. 

**2.** Within a minute of the page being viewed, the system processes the request and checks the     CDN. In the first case, it checks whether the topic was updated since the **Last sync** date. In     either case, after a minute, refresh the page to see the content. 

 ◦ If the topic was updated, it pulls the updated topic into the table and updates the Last sync date. 

 ◦ If the topic was not updated, it displays the local cached or database topic, and updates the Last sync date. 

**3.** If the topic was not in the local database, it pulls the topic into the table if it exists on the CDN.     If it does not exist, there is no action. 

 The administrator can modify the default 15-day synchronization duration in system properties 

 Configuring Embedded Help 

 Plan and configure the Embedded Help topics that your organization's users would benefit from. 

##### Configuration overview 

 You should begin your Embedded Help configuration by planning, including identifying features, forms, and lists that your users could use additional guidance on. Then, begin to map and create or update the topics you will create. 

 Embedded Help planning 

 Before writing custom embedded help, plan the content and note the information used in the Embedded Help form. Careful planning ensures that the topic appears for the right page and role. 

© 2025 ServiceNow, Inc. All rights reserved. ServiceNow, the ServiceNow logo, Now, and other ServiceNow marks are trademarks and/or registered trademarks of ServiceNow, Inc., in the United States and/or other countries. 1028 


 Each UI page can display embedded help, specified in the Page field as shown in the following example. 

 Embedded help topic for the Service Catalog home page 

 In planning for embedded help topics, consider how the following fields are used and note the values that you need for your custom topics. 

 Page 

 Identify and note the UI page name which is found in the URL when the page is displayed as shown. If the page name begins with a dollar sign, such as $mid_server_user, include the dollar sign in the page name. Before you write an embedded help topic for the page, search for the page name to locate a file you can copy. 

 Modifier 

**- Normal** content appears for any user with the appropriate role who navigates to     the page. 

**- Setup** content appears when the page is accessed from a link in Guided Setup. 

 Many embedded help topics in the base system are for Guided Setup. You can copy Setup content and change the Modifier to Normal to quickly provide help for all users. 

 Qualifier 

 Identify pages you want custom help for that are used in many applications. For example the home.do page opens for every Homepage module and for many Dashboard modules. The embedded help administrator can use qualifiers to customize content for a common page in the instance. 

 Role 

 Specify the lowest level role to provide access to this embedded help topic. All roles that contain the role also see the content, unless another topic targeted to their role exists for the same page. 

© 2025 ServiceNow, Inc. All rights reserved. ServiceNow, the ServiceNow logo, Now, and other ServiceNow marks are trademarks and/or registered trademarks of ServiceNow, Inc., in the United States and/or other countries. 1029 


 For example, if you add embedded help content for the itil role that describes your business process for entering incidents, the itil_admin role also sees the content. If you write a different topic with the itil_admin role, the itil_admin sees that content instead of the itil content. 

 Product 

 Write content only for the Enterprise topic. You can copy an Express topic and change this field to Enterprise if appropriate. 

 Version 

 Base system content is typically specified to the current software version. If you are editing the content for a custom application or to provide information relevant to your organization business process, select All. 

 Domain 

 If your organization uses domain separation and customizes help content, specify the domain the content applies to. 

 ServiceNow Help 

 If the check box is selected, this field indicates a base system topic. You cannot edit a base system topic, but you can create a copy to add custom content. 

 Content 

 You can use the formatting tools to format the content. The following list describes the limitations. 

**-** You cannot include images in embedded help content. 

**-** To embed video, you must code the video information in the source code < **<>** >     view. Video content from YouTube and Vimeo are supported. 

**-** To add a related information link, you must use a full URL, not a relative URL. 

**-** Best practice is not to use the highlight text tool, as the color may make text     unreadable depending on the theme the user has selected. 

**-** Any changes you make to embedded help are not automatically deployed to     another instance. 

**-** Changes to the embedded help table are not captured in update sets,     update_sync=false is set intentionally. 

 Use qualifiers in Embedded Help 

 The embedded help administrator can use qualifiers to customize content for a common page in the instance. 

###### Before you begin 

 Role required: embedded_help_admin 

###### About this task 

 The home.do page is opened for every Homepage module and for many Dashboard modules. The specified query parameters in the URL define which homepage to open. 

 Imagine that your organization wants to provide specific instructions for the SLA homepage. You can write custom embedded help content and use a qualifier to accomplish that goal. Create the qualifier, and then associate it with custom embedded help content that you write.

###### Procedure 

**1.** To get the information for the qualifier, open the module in a new browser window and copy the     query parameter. 

 Notice that the query parameter uses underscores between words instead of hyphens or dashes. 

 You can also select the query parameter from the Arguments field on the module link type. To see the module link type, click the pencil icon beside the module in the application navigator, and then click the Link Type tab. 

**2.** Navigate to **Embedded Help** > **Help Qualifiers** , and then click **New**. 

**3.** Complete the form. 

 Embedded help qualifier form 

 Field Description 

 Path Enter the page to display the embedded help content. Do not include .do. For example, for the SLA homepage, enter home. 

 Query params Enter the query parameters or the link argument using the format id=query_parameters. 

##### Warning: If the query parameter contains more than one word, use 

 underscores between words instead of hyphens or dashes. If you use hyphens or dashes, the system uses only the first word in the parameter and ignores the rest. 

 Fragment Enter the #<string> at the end of the URL. 

 This is rarely found in the URL of a page in the instance. If you want custom help for a page that ends with #<string>, place it into this field. 

##### Note: The proven practice is to include at least a query parameter. If you do 

 not, the custom help appears for every home.do page. You can use either the query parameter, the fragment, or both.

 Field Description 

 Qualifier Enter the qualifier to use, for example sla_homepage. Record the qualifier to use in the embedded help content record. 

##### Warning: If the query parameter contains more than one word, use 

 underscores between words instead of hyphens or dashes. If you use hyphens or dashes, the system uses only the first word in the parameter and ignores the rest. 

**4.** Click **Submit**. 

**5.** Follow the steps in Add custom Embedded Help content to create the content, and include the     following information. 

 ◦ Name and Page : The page you created the qualifier for, for example, home. 

 ◦ Qualifier : The qualifier you entered, for example sla_homepage. 

##### Note: You can also copy an existing embedded help topic and enter the qualifier in the 

 copied record. 

**6.** Test the qualifier by opening the page you added the content for, and then opening the help     panel. 

##### Note: If you added a role to the embedded help content, ensure that you are logged in 

 as a user with the role, or impersonate a user with that role.

 Embedded help content can be targeted to users with a specified role who access the UI page. All roles that contain the role also see the content, unless another topic targeted to their role exists for the same page. 

 For example, if you add embedded help content for the itil role that describes your business process for entering incidents, the itil_admin role also sees the content. If you write a different topic with the itil_admin role, the itil_admin sees that content instead of the itil content. 

##### Embedded help role priority 

 The embedded help role priority is stored in the Embedded Help Role Priority [sys_embedded_help_role] table. Each role is assigned a default priority order number based on the role name in the Roles [sys_user_role] table. 

 Default embedded help priority order numbers 

 Order number 

 Role name 

 10 admin 

 Examples: admin, chat_admin, pa_admin, survey_admin 

 Exception: itil_admin 

 100 manager or itil_admin 

 Examples: itil_admin, catalog_manager, content_manager, sla_manager

 Default embedded help priority order numbers (continued) 

 Order number 

 Role name 

 300 itil (only) 

 1000 All other roles or no role (ESS user) 

 Examples: approver_user, financial_management_user, personalize_form, template_editor 

 The priority executes from the lowest number to the highest, meaning that embedded help content with no role displays only if no other content is available for the UI page and the user's role. All base system content is targeted to a role unless the content is intended for all users, including ESS users. When you add a role, such as a role for a custom application, it is automatically added to the Embedded Help Role Priority [sys_embedded_help_role] table with the appropriate default order. You can modify the order of priority as needed. 

 If a page requires different help content for different roles, separate topics must be added. For example, users with any role can access the incident.do page, and it opens with a view appropriate for their role. 

 The following list describes how content for different roles can be targeted for the Incident form. 

 Admin 

 Provides information and links to help with configuring the Incident form. 

 itil_admin 

 Describes how to monitor the progress of the incident. 

 itil 

 Describes how to work on an incident. 

 No role 

 Explains what the user can review and modify in the Self-Service view of the Incident form. 

 Modify embedded help role priority 

 You can modify the default order of priority that is assigned to a role in the Embedded Help Role Priority [sys_embedded_help_role] table. The priority order determines what embedded help content a user accesses on a UI page, based on roles assigned to the user. 

###### Before you begin

 Embedded Help internationalization 

 Embedded help internationalization provides the ability for you to localize your embedded help content to a variety of languages to meet global user needs. You can write your embedded help content in a language of your choice and decide what languages to display. 

 Existing embedded help content records are written in English by default. You can translate the English embedded help content provided with the base system into other languages to meet your needs. You can also create custom embedded help content in the language of your choice. 

##### Understanding localized embedded help content 

 To translate English embedded help content into another language or to create embedded help content in a language other than English, your working session must be configured to the language in which you want to write. For example, you must be working in a French session if you want to write embedded help content in French. Refer to Localization settings for more information. 

 Configure embedded help content to display in the language of your choice by accessing the Language field on the Embedded Help Queue [sys_embedded_help_queue] table. Depending on the foreign language translations activated on your instance, you can choose which language to display your embedded help content. 

 If embedded help content is available in a particular language and users are working in an instance with that language, they will see available embedded help in the desired language. 

##### Working with localized embedded help content 

 When a user requests an embedded help content record, the associated embedded help queue record populates accordingly and the language specified in the embedded help queue record is set to the current session language. 

 When embedded help content is available in a user's session language, content will be shown in that same language. If embedded help content is not available in the user's session language, than English content is shown. However, if you do not want to see English content in a nonEnglish session, you can configure the sys_property to False (default is True). 

##### Embedded help content prioritization 

 Displaying embedded help content in the user's session language takes priority over all other mechanisms, such as role, whether content is user-created, and the latest content version. 

 When a user is in a non-English working session, the priority for embedded help content display is as follows: 

**1.** Working-session language (other than English) content displays, if available. 

**2.** User-created content displays when working-session language content is not available. 

**3.** Version-related content displays when working-session language and user-created content are     not available. 

 For example, if an admin user is in a French working session and requests embedded help content, but French content is not available for the admin role, the same-language content for a lower role is displayed if available. 

 If there is no embedded help content for the French admin role, but there is content for the French itil role and English admin role, the French itil role takes priority over the English admin role. The French-language content will display at the itil-role level.

 Create internationalized embedded help 

 Translate provided English embedded help content into other languages or create custom embedded help content in the language of your choice. 

###### Before you begin 

 Role required: embedded_help_admin or admin 

###### About this task 

 All embedded help content records are in English by default. To create a non-English embedded help content record, there must first be an English content record in the Embedded Help [sys_embedded_help_content] table. The English embedded help content record is parent to all other language embedded help content records. Once you create a non-English embedded help content record, it resides in the Translated Texts [sys_translated_text] table. To translate provided English content into another language, create a copy of the English content record and save the edited, non-English, copy record. The new record is saved to the Translated Texts [sys_translated_text] table. Refer to Add custom embedded help from a copy to translate available embedded help content. 

 To create a non-English custom embedded help content record, your working instance must be configured to the same language you intend to write in. You create custom non-English embedded help content when English embedded help content is not available to copy. 

 After creating a non-English embedded help content record, you must create the same content record in English and store it in the Embedded Help [sys_embedded_help_content] table. The English embedded help content record is parent to all other languages. 

###### Procedure 

**1.** Navigate to **All** > **Embedded Help** > **Help Content**. 

**2.** Open the embedded help topic to copy.     You can also open an embedded help topic by selecting **Edit Help Article** from the menu in     the embedded help pane.

 Domain separation and Embedded Help 

 Domain separation is supported for Embedded Help. Domain separation enables you to separate data, processes, and administrative tasks into logical groupings called domains. You can control several aspects of this separation, including which users can see and access data. 

##### Support level: Basic 

© 2025 ServiceNow, Inc. All rights reserved. ServiceNow, the ServiceNow logo, Now, and other ServiceNow marks are trademarks and/or registered trademarks of ServiceNow, Inc., in the United States and/or other countries. 1043 


**-** Business logic: Ensure that data goes into the proper domain for the application’s service     provider use cases. 

**-** The application supports domain separation at run time. The domain separation includes     separation from the user interface, cache keys, reporting, rollups, and aggregations. 

**-** The owner of the instance must set up the application to function across multiple tenants. 

 Sample use case: When a service provider (SP) uses chat to respond to a tenant-customer’s message, the customer must be able to see the SP's response. 

 For more information on support levels, see Application support for domain separation. 

##### Overview 

 The goal of Embedded Helpis to enable your users to benefit from base system help topics, as well as to create your own custom help topics. If your organization uses domain separation, you can create custom embedded help for each domain. 

##### How domain separation works in Embedded Help 

 If your organization uses domain separation, you can create custom embedded help for each domain. To associate help content with a domain, the administrator configures the Help Content form to include the Domain field. When custom content is created, the author selects the domain to which the content applies. 

##### Note: 

**-** Content with no specified domain is in the global domain. 

**-** If domain-specific content does not exist for a user in a domain, the user sees the global     help content. 

**-** Users in the global domain only see global help content. An administrator who wants to     test domain-specific help must impersonate a user in that domain.

 What's New 

 The What's New tab in the Help Center displays information about the new and important features for applications in your instance, including features from the latest ServiceNow release(s). 

 The What's New tab is a great way to learn about features, which are existing features and of what will be available to you on version upgrade (if not on the latest versions), without having to rely on the documentation site. The content in the What’s new tab is relevant to each application the tab is accessed from and the role of the user accessing the content. 

##### Note: Starting with this release, you can navigate to What's New in Help Center across all 

 experiences. Configuration support for this new feature is available in classic and custom pages. This feature is however, not supported for non-Polaris users. 

© 2025 ServiceNow, Inc. All rights reserved. ServiceNow, the ServiceNow logo, Now, and other ServiceNow marks are trademarks and/or registered trademarks of ServiceNow, Inc., in the United States and/or other countries. 1056 


 If there is new content available for you, the Help Center button is indicated. The blue indicator next to a feature notifies that the feature content is new and unread for the application and the user on your instance. 

 You can select a feature from the tab to access the feature page for more information including video demos and graphics if available. A view all features option is included at the bottom. 

 The feature page displays information on all new features for the application. Features are tagged to notify you of their availability state. In this example, Configure the Catalog Builder experience for catalog item editors, is a feature that is not available. This could be either due to an upgrade requirement, or due to the required plugins for the feature not being installed on the instance. For most features, links are provided to expand information or to navigate to the documentation site. 

#### Onboarding modals 

 Onboarding modals provide a wizard-like experience to introduce users to new experiences and applications in their ServiceNow 

 ® Next Experience instance. 

 Some onboarding modals are included by default in your instance, such as the onboarding modal displayed the first time you log in to an instance with Next Experience enabled. You can also create your own custom onboarding modals to introduce new experiences and applications to users. 

 When you switch between dark, light or coral user interface themes, the images in Onboarding modals match the theme of the instance you choose. This provides a visually cohesive experience.

##### Domain separation and Guided Setup 

 Domain separation is supported for Guided Setup. Domain separation enables you to separate data, processes, and administrative tasks into logical groupings called domains. You can control several aspects of this separation, including which users can see and access data. 

© 2025 ServiceNow, Inc. All rights reserved. ServiceNow, the ServiceNow logo, Now, and other ServiceNow marks are trademarks and/or registered trademarks of ServiceNow, Inc., in the United States and/or other countries. 1068 


##### Support level: Basic 

**-** Business logic: Ensure that data goes into the proper domain for the application’s service     provider use cases. 

**-** The application supports domain separation at run time. The domain separation includes     separation from the user interface, cache keys, reporting, rollups, and aggregations. 

**-** The owner of the instance must set up the application to function across multiple tenants. 

 Sample use case: When a service provider (SP) uses chat to respond to a tenant-customer’s message, the customer must be able to see the SP's response. 

 For more information on support levels, see Application support for domain separation. 

##### Key points 

 There are some key points to note with domain separation support. 

**-** Guided Setup player can view new guided setup execution for every domain. 

**-** Creation and updation of Guided Setup is allowed in global domain scope only. This requires     builder roles. 

 Migration of existing setups is initiated only in global scope. 

 Status of setups in progress is shown as applicable to the domain scopes.

 Each tour may consist of steps where users can either read information or engage in interactive experiences. For instance, the "Explore Service Portal Home Page" tour highlights the features of the Service Portal, while the "Create an Incident in Workspaces" tour guides users through the process of creating an incident, resulting in a new record being added to the Incidents list.

 GTD components 

 Learn about the Guided Tours components. 

 Guided Tours are composed of the following components that function as building blocks for the tours that you create. 

 Guided Tours components 

 Component Description 

 Introduction The introduction outlines the steps in the guided tour and describes the milestone you achieve when all actions are completed. 

 Step 

 A discrete component of a guided tour that indicates a sequence. 

 A step can provide a definition, an instruction, or both. 

 Callout 

 The callout provides the definition and instructions for the current tour step, including guidance to move to the next step. It highlights the relevant element and provides step-by-step instructions for navigating the ServiceNow 

 ® user interface. 

 You can position callouts anywhere in your user interface to provide additional context or task-related instructions. There are several display options for the callouts, including: 

**-** Above 

**-** Below 

**-** To the left 

**-** To the right 

 You can customize the Service Portal guided tour callout colors. For more information, see Guided Tour callout color. 

 Element The specific components that the tour refers to, such as database records or page components. 

 Elements require formatting so that the tour can link to them. 

 Trigger 

 Triggers are actions that you take to advance the tour to the next step. Triggers include pressing the Enter key, selecting or right-clicking a UI element, or selecting a Next button in the callout. 

 For more information, see GTD triggers. 

 Conclusion A conclusion indicating that the tour is complete. It is a great opportunity to encourage users to explore other tours or provide follow-up information on what to do next.

 GTD triggers 

 Triggers are actions that you take to move the tour to the next step. Each callout in a guided tour step has a specific trigger that activates the subsequent step. You define the trigger for each callout, and only relevant triggers appear based on the UI element referenced by the callout. 

 Guided tour triggers 

 Action Description 

 Next Button The callout includes a^ Next^ button that the user can select to move on to the next step. This feature is useful in the following situations: 

**-** When the callout describes the element it’s pointing to, enabling the user to     progress without needing to select any UI elements. 

**-** When entering information into a reference or date picker field. Users can use the     lookup function, manually enter data, or select it from a list. They can proceed     once they’ve completed the necessary entry for the step. 

 Click the Element 

 The tour advances to the next step when the targeted element is selected. 

 For more information on how to display a step on a different page after users click a link, see How to show a step on a different page after the user clicked on a link (KB0725875). 

 Mouse over the Element 

 The tour advances to the next step when the user hovers the mouse device over the element. 

 Rightclick the Element 

 The tour moves to the next step when the element indicated by the callout is rightclicked. 

 Press Enter key 

 When the user presses the Enter key, the tour proceeds to the next step. This action acknowledges that the user has submitted input, such as in a text box. 

 Change Element Value 

 The tour advances to the next step when the user enters or selects a value in a field and then clicks outside of it. 

 Press any key 

 The tour advances to the next step when the user presses any key. 

 Select The tour proceeds to the next step when the user selects an option from the dropdown menu. 

 Double click The tour moves to the next step when the user double-clicks an element. 

 GTD interface 

 The Guided Tour Designer (GTD) provides an easy way to create guided tours. You can easily drag a callout to the element you want to highlight and enter instructions for each step, along with the corresponding trigger. As you add steps, you have the option to test and modify them as needed. 

 The GTD has the following features:

**-** If there is no click action on the elements that are selectable while creating the     tour, place the callout on the parent element. 

##### Configuring Guided Tours 

 Guided tour configurations allow you to enable, create, modify, and customize tours, as well as configure them to launch automatically and customize the tour experience. 

 Plan Guided Tours 

 Planning is essential before entering a guided tour into the system. Create an outline and include any assumptions to assist you during the tour creation. 

##### Planning a guided tour 

 Before outlining a guided tour, consider these factors: 

 Purpose of the tour 

 Decide whether to create a tour that describes a user interface or one that helps users complete a task. Conduct research and break down the main goal into clear, manageable steps. 

 Accessibility of the tour 

 Enable the tour on your production system to help users perform routine tasks like ordering from the Service Catalog or creating incidents. If your aim is to train users to explore these tasks without creating real records, provide the tour on your nonproduction system. 

 Name of the tour 

 Choose a unique, intuitive tour name that clearly indicates its purpose, like “Create a New Incident” or “Review the Incident List”. 

 Customize the instructions so that each user creates a unique record. For instance, if the tour instructs users on how to create a group called "Facilities," you can avoid duplicate name errors for subsequent users by prompting them in a callout to assign a unique value to the group name field. 

 User's knowledge about the task 

 Not all users who take the tour have the same knowledge level. Evaluate the information needed to make sure that participants comprehend the content from the start. 

 When planning your tour, consider addressing the following additional questions: 

**-** What page should the tour start on? 

**-** What steps are important to accomplish the objective? 

**-** How should a user navigate from one step to the next? 

##### Selecting triggers 

 Triggers are actions that you take to move the tour to the next step. Each callout in a guided tour step has a specific trigger that activates the subsequent step. You define the trigger for each callout, and only relevant triggers appear based on the UI element referenced by the callout. 

© 2025 ServiceNow, Inc. All rights reserved. ServiceNow, the ServiceNow logo, Now, and other ServiceNow marks are trademarks and/or registered trademarks of ServiceNow, Inc., in the United States and/or other countries. 1077 


 For more information, see GTD triggers. 

##### Using callouts 

 You must place a callout on top of an element to interact with it. The element is highlighted in blue when it’s selected as the target. 

 In the following example, it looks like the callout is pointing to the context menu icon, but notice that the header bar is highlighted blue. 

 Incorrect callout placement for the context menu 

 This example depicts the correct placement of the callout for the context menu. Notice that the context menu icon is highlighted blue. 

 Correct callout placement for the context menu 

 The following tips may also be helpful: 

**-** When you place a callout on a form that contains tabs, consider that a user may not have the     tab open for viewing. Create a new callout that instructs the user to first open the tab before     proceeding with the rest of the tour. 

**-** When adding callouts to fields with dynamic content, keep them minimal. If users can’t locate     the associated tour element due to a delayed page refresh, the tour may end unexpectedly. 

**-** When you guide a user through pop-up windows, add your callout to the originating page on     or near the pop-up icon. Within the callout instructions, guide your user through the steps     intended for the pop-up window, because callouts can’t be added to the pop-up window. 

**-** While the color of a callout is static in the Standard platform UI, you can customize callouts     on Service Portal. Consider using this capability to make sure that a consistent look-and-feel     between your callouts and your Service Portal pages. 

##### Auto-launching your tour 

 Automatically start a tour if you want users to take the tour on their first visit to the page. 

 You can choose to launch multiple tours automatically from a single starting page. You can set the auto-launch order so that users start the second tour on their second page visit, the third tour on their third page visit, and so on. Use this option if you want to begin with an introductory tour and then add more complex or focused follow-up tours.

###### Procedure 

**1.** Navigate to **All** > **Guided Tour Designer** > **Configure Auto Launch**.     The Configure Auto Launch page shows tiles for each page that has one or more configured     tours. You can filter the tiles by part of or the entire page name, and sort them by name or by     the most recently edited tours. 

**2.** Select a tile that represents the page where you want the tour to launch automatically.

 a. Repeat steps 2–3 for additional tours that you want to enable for auto-launch. The tours move to the top of the list in the order that you enable them. 

 b. Drag rows to reorder the tours so they appear in the order you want users to see when they visit the page successive times. For example, the first tour may provide an overview of a page while the second tour guides the user through a specific task. 

 When users access a page that has a guided tour enabled for auto-launch, the tour begins immediately. If they stop the tour by selecting the X icon on a tour step, a message appears that provides them with the option to stop both the current tour and other tours from autolaunching the next time they access the page.

 Filter the tasks in the board by: 

**-** Entering the title or number of the task card 

**-** Selecting an option in the **Due By** list 

 Lanes Organize cards on a board into vertical groups. These groups often represent the status of the task, such as To Do , Doing , and Done. 

 When using a guided board, each lane represents a possible field value. For example, a board on the Incident table can display one lane for each State value such as New , Active , or Resolved. 

 Users can move cards from one lane to another to update the task that card represents. 

 Cards Represent individual tasks that you can assign to users. You can add comments, attachments, and labels to cards. Each card is tied to a task record; updating one immediately updates the other. For freeform boards, each card represents a personal task.

###### Procedure 

**1.** Navigate to sys_properties.list. 

###### 2. Locate the glide.ui.create_task_type_option_list property. 

**3.** Edit the **Value** to add or remove tables.     You can add any table that extends Task [task]. Use the table name, not the label. For example,     you would enter change_request, not Change Request. Ensure the tables listed are     separated by commas, with no spaces.     The property value populates the task type selection list users choose from when they create     a task from a checklist item. Note that users can only see task types for which they have the     appropriate access roles. 

##### Visual Task Boards reference 

 The following sections describe the installed components and properties for Visual Task Boards, along with domain separation and supported browser information. 

 Domain separation and Visual Task Boards 

 Domain separation is supported in the Visual Task Boards application. Domain separation enables you to separate data, processes, and administrative tasks into logical groupings called domains. You can control several aspects of this separation, including which users can see and access data. 

##### Support level: Basic 

**-** Business logic: Ensure that data goes into the proper domain for the application’s service     provider use cases. 

**-** The application supports domain separation at run time. The domain separation includes     separation from the user interface, cache keys, reporting, rollups, and aggregations. 

**-** The owner of the instance must set up the application to function across multiple tenants. 

 Sample use case: When a service provider (SP) uses chat to respond to a tenant-customer’s message, the customer must be able to see the SP's response. 

 For more information on support levels, see Application support for domain separation.

##### How domain separation works in Visual Task Boards 

 Visual Task Boards that are "data-driven" show the data from tables that are like Task tables. The data that is domain separated is also supported. 

 Condition-based criteria is used to filter that data. Free-form VTBs' use Private Tasks (vtb_task), which supports domain separation as an extension of Task and inherits domain separation logic as a result.

#### Timeline Visualizations 

 A timeline visualization is a representation of an organization's activities over time. 

 Typically, timeline visualizations are useful for quickly assessing the impact of future strategic and operational activities such as change requests and projects. Timeline visualizations come in two varieties: a two-dimensional (2D) view where activities are grouped by month, and a threedimensional (3D) view where activities are grouped in lanes. Both views are interactive, and the 2D view can be printed. 

 Timeline administrators, users with the timeline_admin role, can set up visualizations to represent ITSM-related activities, such as incidents, problems, changes, and projects. Timeline administrators or users with the timeline_user role can personalize their timeline visualizations from the Settings pane in the visualization. 

 The CIO Roadmap timeline visualization shows your organization's projects grouped by portfolios. Organizational leaders can use the CIO Roadmap to monitor and evaluate the status of current and upcoming projects. 

##### Note: Activating timeline visualizations does not activate predefined CIO roadmap. You 

 require PPM (com.snc.financial_planning_pmo) plugin to use CIO roadmap. 

##### Key terms for timeline visualizations 

 Lane 

 A logical grouping of items on the 3D timeline visualization. For example, one lane might show pending projects while another lane shows open projects.

 Timeline visualization configuration filtering and sorting form field descriptions 

 Field Description 

 Lane condition Condition builder used to create filters and apply sorting to values that are used as lanes in 3D view visualizations. For example, if you set [Name] [is not] [IT] as a lane condition for the CIO Roadmap, then IT no longer appears as a lane in the roadmap, nor does it appear as a lane option in the Settings pane. Removing the filter restores the IT lane to the visualization and to lane options in the Settings pane. 

 To order the results, specify sorting based on relevant field names. For example, to order the portfolio names so that they appear in reverse alphabetical order on the CIO Roadmap, set the sort fields to [Name] [z to a]. 

 Panel condition 

 Condition builder used to create filters and apply sorting to values that are used as panels in 2D and 3D view visualizations. For example, if you set [State] [is one of] [Pending, Open, Work in Progress] as the panel condition for the CIO Roadmap, only projects that are in one of those states appear on the roadmap.

 roadmap. 

 Examples of other fields that are suitable for this selection include Priority , Risk , and Approval. 

 Label 1 

 Label 2 

 Label 3 

 Label 4 

 Values to be color coded. The values available are determined by the Panel color key field. For example, the CIO Roadmap is based on the Project table and has the Panel color key set to the State field, which contains the values Pending , Open , Work in Progress , Closed Complete , Closed Incomplete , and Closed Skipped. 

 You can set set specific colors for up to four values from the selected field. Other values are shown in the Default color. 

 Default color 

 Color applied to values that are not selected for labels. For example, the CIO Roadmap color codes and creates labels for the values Pending , Open , Work in Progress , and Closed Complete. The additional values, Closed Incomplete and Closed Skipped , use the default color. 

 Color 1 

 Color 2 

 Color 3 

 Color 4 

 Colors that correspond to each of the Label field values. For example, if Label 1 is the Pending state, and Color 1 is red , then panels for projects in the pending state are red. 

##### Create a Timeline Visualization view 

 The timeline visualization view determines which record details appear in the pop-up summary window when a user clicks a panel. 

###### Before you begin 

 Role required: admin 

###### About this task 

 You can create one timeline visualization view per table. For example, if your view shows incident records, you can create a view on the Incident table to show only certain information, such as the incident number, priority, and short description. 

 If no Timeline Visualization view exists, all panels use the default view that shows all the fields that currently appear on the default view of the form for that table. After you create a Timeline Visualization view for a table, all panels then use that view. 

 For example, to create a Timeline Visualization view using the Incident form:

##### Planning Your Timeline Visualization 

 Before creating a timeline visualization, you should have a clear idea of the information that you want to display. 

 This planning process helps you identify the required table and fields, and determine filtering and sorting requirements. Since users can personalize the visualization, avoid setting restrictive filters that may prevent users from finding categories that they are accustomed to seeing. You can use the CIO Roadmap as a starting point for creating your own timeline visualizations. 

##### Note: Activating timeline visualizations doesn't activate predefined CIO roadmap. You 

 require PPM (com.snc.financial_planning_pmo) plugin to use CIO roadmap. 

##### Use Timeline Visualization 

 Timeline Visualization provides a high-level view of an organization's strategic and operational activities over time. 

 Organizational decision makers can use the information in visualizations for activities such as planning future projects and estimating resource requirements. Users can personalize the information displayed with the visualization Settings pane. 

 Activating the Timeline Visualization application does not install the CIO Roadmap. You require PPM (com.snc.financial_planning_pmo) plugin to use CIO roadmap. CIO Roadmap is a timeline visualization that displays an organization's IT projects and portfolios. This following sections use the CIO Roadmap to demonstrate features of timeline visualizations. 

 Lanes, markers, and panels 

 Lanes, markers, and panels are the fundamental elements of a timeline visualization. appear in the 3D view only. 

##### Note: Lanes and markers are available in the 3D view only. A panel in the 2D view always 

 represents a single record, while panels in 3D view may represent one or more records. 

##### Lanes 

 A lane is a channel in which activities are grouped. A visualization can display up to eight lanes at a time. While viewing a visualization, you can use the Settings pane to show or hide individual lanes. 

##### Note: The number of items displayed in a lane depends on the Max items per lane and 

 Max items per lane 2d settings on Timeline Visualization form.

##### Markers 

 Markers are horizontal lines that cross all lanes and identify a transition to the next month. 

##### Panels 

 Panels in both 2D and 3D views are color coded according to values that the administrator selects during the initial setup. 

 In 2D view, panels are grouped by month and stacked in chronological order, from the earliest date to the latest date. By default, the 2D view opens with the current month displayed on the left side of the visualization. You can print visualizations from the 2D view using the browser's print option. In 3D view, panels are grouped in lanes and ordered by date, from earliest to latest. The date that appears on the panel determines its placement in 2D and 3D view. The date displayed is based on a value the timeline administrator selects during initial setup. 

 Panels appear in the CIO Roadmap according to the planned completion date for the project. In 3D view, projects with the same planned date of completion are consolidated into a single panel. In 2D view, projects with the same planned date of completion are displayed as individual panels. 

 Panel headers in the CIO Roadmap are color coded based on project state. However, in 3D view, if a panel represents more than one project, the panel header is colored black. The Settings pane contains a key showing each available project state and the corresponding color. 

##### Note: Activating timeline visualizations doesn't activate predefined CIO roadmap. You 

 require PPM (com.snc.financial_planning_pmo) plugin to use CIO roadmap. 

 To view additional information about a panel: 

**-** Click a panel for a single record while in 2D or 3D view to open a summary window that     contains additional information. Click the heading in the summary window to open the full     record. 

**-** Press the Shift key and then click a panel to open the full record. 

**-** Click a panel that represents multiple records to open a list of those records. Click a record     number to open the full record. 

 The timeline administrator can configure the information that appears in summary windows. 

 Personalize Timeline Visualizations 

 You can configure settings for timeline visualizations like lane and panel conditions, colors, and labels. 

##### Personalization 

 Open the Settings pane and click Configure. Complete the form as appropriate (see table).

 Visualization personalization 

 Timeline visualization personalization form 

 Field Description 

 Lane conditions Condition builder used to create filters and apply sorting to values that are used as lanes in 3D view visualizations. For example, if you set [Name] [is not] [IT] as a lane condition for the CIO Roadmap, then IT no longer appears as a lane in the roadmap, nor does it appear as a lane option in the Settings pane. Removing the filter restores the IT lane to the visualization and to lane options in the Settings pane. 

 To order the results, specify sorting based on relevant field names. For example, to order the portfolio names so that they appear in reverse alphabetical order on the CIO Roadmap, set the sort fields to [Name] [z to a]. 

 Panel conditions 

 Condition builder used to create filters and apply sorting to values that are used as panels in the visualization. For example, if you set [State] [is one of] [Pending, Open, Work in Progress] as the panel condition for the CIO Roadmap, only projects that are in one of those states appear on the roadmap. 

 Panel color key Field from the Panel table that contains values used for color coding the information displayed. The field selected here determines the values that are available in the Label fields on the form. 

 The CIO Roadmap uses State, which is a field in the Project table. Panels on the CIO Roadmap are color coded according to the project state, which can be Pending, Open, Work in Progress, Closed Complete, Closed Incomplete, and Skipped. 

 Examples of other fields that are suitable for this selection include Priority, Risk, and Approval. 

 Label 1 

 Label 2 

 Label 3 

 Label 4 

 Values to be color coded. The values available are determined by the Panel color key field. For example, the CIO Roadmap is based on the Project table and has the Panel color key' set to the State field, which contains the values Pending, Open, Work in Progress, Closed Complete, Closed Incomplete, and Closed Skipped. 

 You can set specific colors for up to four values from the selected field. Other values are shown in the Default color.

 Field Description 

 Default color 

 Color applied to values that are not selected for labels. For example, the CIO Roadmap color codes and creates labels for the values Pending, Open, Work in Progress, and Closed Complete. The additional values, Closed Incomplete and Closed Skipped, use the default color. 

 Color 1 

 Color 2 

 Color 3 

 Color 4 

 Colors that correspond to each of the Label field values. For example, if Label 1 is the Pending state, and Color 1 is red, then panels for projects in the pending state are red. 

##### Note: 

**-** Activating timeline visualizations doesn't activate predefined CIO roadmap. You require     PPM (com.snc.financial_planning_pmo) plugin to use CIO roadmap. 

**-** If the **Max items per lane** field is set to more than 1000 , you may observe a delay when     displaying the timeline data using Internet Explorer (IE) as the browser.

##### Note: Activating timeline visualizations doesn't activate predefined CIO roadmap. You 

 require PPM (com.snc.financial_planning_pmo) plugin to use CIO roadmap. 

 For the CIO Roadmap, the slider track allows you to quickly view the distribution of projects over time and determine project states. While in 3D view, click and drag the slider to move the timeline forward or backward. In 2D view, click and drag the slider track right or left to move the timeline forward or backward. 

 The slider track provides an alternative view of panels on a visualization. For the CIO Roadmap, a colored dot in the slider track indicates the presence of one or more projects for a given day. The different dot colors correspond to different project states. This allows you to scan the slider track to identify projects of interest by their color, and then use the slider or slider track to quickly navigate to those projects. For example, if you are interested in projects that are in a pending state, you can use the slider to navigate to the colored dots that represent that state. 

##### Note: Dots in the slider track do not correspond one-to-one with panels in a visualization. 

 A dot represents the presence of one or more projects on a given date. In 3D view, if there is more than one project for a given day, all of the projects for that day are combined into a single panel on the roadmap. When the slider track is populated, projects in a multi project panel are analyzed for project state and then represented as appropriately colored dots in the slider track. 

 Similarly, you can use the slider or slider track in conjunction with the calendar to quickly navigate to any point in time. For example, if you are concerned about resource issues in April 2014 because you see a large cluster of dots during that time, dragging the slider or slider track to those dots brings those projects into view. Click the individual panels to view additional information. 

 View timeline visualization 

 You can view timeline visualizations from a project. 

###### Before you begin 

 Role required: none 

###### Procedure 

**1.** Navigate to **Project** > **Projects** > **All**. 

**2.** Scroll to the bottom of the list and click the **Timeline Visualization** related link. 

 By default, the CIO Roadmap opens in three-dimensional (3D) view with the current date at the forefront of the timeline. You can use the Settings pane to change between two-dimensional (2D) and 3D view. As soon as you view a timeline visualization, it is considered personalized. After that, you see your personalized view even if the timeline administrator makes changes to the default visualization. 

##### Note: Activating timeline visualizations doesn't activate predefined CIO roadmap. You 

 require PPM (com.snc.financial_planning_pmo) plugin to use CIO roadmap. 

 Timeline administrators can create timeline visualizations on other tables. If you are not sure whether a timeline visualization exists for a certain application, use the application navigator to open the application of your choice, and click All. If a timeline visualization exists for the application's table, a Timeline Visualization related link appears. 

 Work with timeline visualizations 

 There are various tools that allow you to move visualizations backward and forward in time depending on whether you are in 2D or 3D view.
